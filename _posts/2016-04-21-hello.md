My name is Nathan Harrington. I live in Holly Springs, NC with my wife
and our seven children. I work at Wasatch Photonics, where I develop
software to help deliver spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography
research systems. Most of this work is in Python.


I am passionate about efficiency, achievement and team work. I enjoy
user interface design, exploration and photography.
