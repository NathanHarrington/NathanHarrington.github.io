of failure.</p>
<p>You are busy. You are valuable to the organization. There are things
that you are uniquely good at. This process will help you focus on those
things. Invest in freeing your time, and reap huge benefits as your
productivity increases through the systemization of your repetitive
tasks.</p>
<p>Goal: Create a transformative experience that increases your productivity 80%.</p>
<p>For any information related task, find a mechanism to discover
information workers, assign the work, and get 80% of the quality of
results in 20% of the time of doing each step manually yourself.</p>
<p>There are many resources espousing the benefits and mechanisms for
finding a virtual assistant. Some of the best:</p>
<p><a href="https://tim.blog/2010/11/02/virtual-assistants/">4HWW</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245561">Outsource Entrepreneur</a></p>
<p>This document is about the specific tactics used to find a virtual
assistant to help with biotechnology research related tasks. The main
assumption to be tested is that the search, identification and collation
of data can be outsourced. The first step is to identify a goal, and
then walk through each portion of the creation step manually. Then, once
the variation in research paths has been reduced to a known set of
states, (including an 'unknown' state), apply quantification metrics to
each end state.  Communicate the exact process to potential candidates,
and then evaluate their performance quantitatively.</p>
<p>Here's a quick example of what <em>not</em> to do:</p>
<p>Go into a local life sciences research library funded by the state's
biotech program. Ask for help finding market research reports on
diffraction gratings. Watch as they type in 'defraction grading' into a
life sciences database search tool and get zero results.</p>
<p>This is not their fault - this is your fault. This is an under
specification of search requirements, coupled with poor communication on
your part.</p>
<h2>A better example is:</h2>
<p><pre>
Search google for "diffraction grating" with quotes
Click the company page
Click products
Find any diffraction grating
    none available? -&gt; Go to next google result
    At least one available?
        Create a new google doc for that company
        Append every diffraction grating specification of size, lpmm,
        center wavelength and cost on a new row in the google
        spreadsheet
        Add the company name to the main diffraction grating research
        document.
        Add a link to the company specific google doc to the main
        diffraction grating research document.
</pre>
Understand that this level of verbosity is not demeaning. This
specification of exact work products and steps to achieve them is
exactly what is required for effective collaboration. They have deep,
valuable skills in interpreting difficult to read web pages and
understanding where to find the information you are looking for.
Leverage their capabilities by first establishing a highly detailed set
of rules for building a shared language of activities.</p>
<p>The goal here is to eliminate the task as a variable. You're looking to
refine your candidates by spending approximately 500$ and 80 hours
collectively. What you're testing here is not your ability to write a
coherent task, but rather which candidates can communicate effectively
immediately.  Then you take it to phase two where you interview them in
person and share more of the strategic direction to see what level of
insight they can provide.</p>
<pre>
Day 1: Post job, invite candidates
Day 2: Screen candidate responses
Day 3: Screen candidate responses, evalute estimates
Day 4: Screen candidate responses, evalute estimates
Day 5: Qualify results
</pre>

<p>At the end of day 5, you'll have a list of all the companies that make
volume phase holographic gratings. Ideally they will have found new
companies, if not you've at least had a bunch of eyes searching for the
same thing.</p>
<p>They also have a spreadsheet that lists all of the diffraction gratings
from the company, along with costs and size and lpmm, etc.</p>
<p>This is the data on which you can build your knowledge. You're strategic
goals are to understand the direct competitors. What you will then be in
a unique position to do is look at the competitors and see where their
products compare directly in specification to ours.</p>
<p>That's the analysis you will do. The theory here is that because I will
outsource the collection, it will be faster than if I do it myself.</p>
<p>Then instead of a countless iteration of manually checking websites to
collate the data and fighting off fatigue, I'm meeting with people and
utilizing my unique strengths.</p>

<p>Title: Find the names and product listing of transmission diffraction grating companies.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below and stop after 3 hours and share your results.</p>
<p>Search google for "transmission diffraction grating" without the quotes</p>
<p>Ignore google scholar links.
Ignore google image links.
Ignore 'people also ask' links.</p>
<p>The Stop List, Found List, and gratings list is available on this google
doc: https://goo.gl/zhbi3v</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the next link of the google results</li>
<li>Is link in 'Stop list'?
    Yes -&gt; Go back to step 1.
    No -&gt; go to step 3</li>
<li>Is link in the 'Found list'
    Yes -&gt; Go to back to step 1
    No -&gt; Go to step 4</li>
<li>Add the link to the Found List:
    Open the 'Found List' tab of the google sheet.
    Add the company name and the url
    Continue to step 5</li>
<li>Find a list of transmission gratings on the links' website. </li>
</ol>
<p>For each grating found, update the "Gratings List" tab of the
spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Equivalents for lpmm column include: lines/mm, l/mm, groove density.</p>
<p>Equivalents for diffraction efficiency column include: efficiency, absolute
efficiency.</p>
<p>If the links website is not a company (for example an education page
about gratings), add to the 'Stop List' and go back to step 1.</p>
<p>If the links website is a company, but does not have gratings for sale,
add to the 'Stop List' and go back to step 1.</p>
<p>If the links website is a company with gratings for sale but does not
have one of the fields of specification, fill in the value with NA.</p>
<ol>
<li>If this is link 1-39 processed, go back to step 1. Otherwise, continue
to step 8.</li>
<li>If this is the 40th link processed, stop the entire process, share
results.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first example of the results populated are shown in the google drive
document. Edmund optics is a good example because it lists the required
fields for each grating. These gratings are all transmission gratings,
not reflective gratings.</p>
<p>Only include transmission gratings in the document. Here are examples of
reflective gratings, do not include these or any like them:
https://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/gratings/reflective-ruled-diffraction-gratings/
https://www.newport.com/f/plane-holographic-reflection-gratings</p>
<p>Stop after 3 hours and share your results.</p>
<p>Thank you for your fastest reply.

<h2>Search for candidates:</h2>
<p><pre>
    Search for a keyword from an education field that would include the
        subject, for example "physics".
    Set the filters to the following settings:
        Hourly rate: $10 and below
        Earned amount: 1K+
        Freelancer type: Independent freelancer
        Location: Asia
Look through each candidates short biography. If they contain any of the
keywords listed below, invite them to the job:</p>
<p>Data Entry
Technical report writing
Academic writing
information extraction
attention to detail
graduate of BS physics (anything indicating an actual Physics degree,
has to be BS or higher)
</pre></p>
<p>At first pass, this has produced about a 90% invite rate. Have invited
26 out of the first 30 entries.</p>
<p>This did not produce good results. This was a failure. The best results
you had was a cut and paste job from Susil 3 hours at 6$/hour that would
have taken you maybe 1 hour at most.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it wasn't a failure. It just feels like it's the wrong
person. That it's not an ultra-refined process so you need to spend alot
more, but you don't have a budget for alot more. Hmm.. If my time is
worth 50/hour, then every hour I save at 45/hour is still coming out
ahead.</p>
<h2>Failure of upwork process due to lake of refinement</h2>
<p>2017-12-26 13:15 I'm not clear enough about what is plain processing
according to rules, and what requires inuitive savvy that truly
represents your value.</p>
<p>Working backward - the face to face interaction with innovation
professionals, spectroscopists and potential customers is the place
where you can bring unique value. Everything else is a task that needs
to be automated to serve this purpose.</p>
<p>The following are the steps required to create these rules. This is
inspired primarily by: 
<a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/the-email-management-system-that-saved-my-life/">Email system that saved my
life</a>
and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QNnxkrJGW8&amp;feature=youtu.be">partner video</a></p>
<p>The goal here is to create a flow chart image for sharing. The time
should be spent on rules, not on moving the components around or manual
edge labelling. </p>
<p>Use graphviz to create a directed graph that will catch every email. The
initial strategy is to setup a framework and have the discipline to
categorize all of the emails. Write down the exact decision making
process for each email. This is the core skill that will take time up
front, but will pay off very quickly for you, and whomever you outsource
your email to.</p>
<p>Start with this general framework.</p>

<p>In practice it looks like:</p>

    (Make a change to the workflow graph)

    ./render_show_flowchart.sh email_workflow.gv 5

<h2>Implementation Narrative</h2>
<p>You're probably thinking - that's nice, but who wants that level of
process and abstraction impinging on my productivity? If you're a person
like me - hugely vulnerable to visual distractions, you desparately want
to live with the wrongness of the dot language edge routing. You
explicitly do not want to use ASCII art by hand, LibreOffice Draw, or
google sheets to position boxes. You want logical flow only in text mode
so you can rapidly iterate through the real value add: The exact
creation of a workflow to make email processing faster:</p>
<p>Step 1:
Follow the workflow document.</p>
<p>Step 2:
When an email arrives that does not meet any rules, iterate through the
creation of a rule at this position:
