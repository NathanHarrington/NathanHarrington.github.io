<h4>Incorporation:</h4>
<p>Customer segment definition:</p>
<p>At the end - a deep understanding of the persona and archectype. Who are
they, why would they buy, why won't they buy. What do you need to say to
them?</p>
<p>If you spend your energy out of the building, it will make your company
incredibly efficient at figuring out how to market and sell to them.</p>
<p>What job are we getting done for the customer.</p>
<p>What functional or social jobs
What emotional jobs
What problems or needs are we solving.
What gains are we providign the customer
What pains are we solving.</p>
<p>Chapter 2.
What is the customer segment trying to get done?
    What functional or social jobs are getting done?
    Does the customer want to perform or complete  a specific task?
    Or solve a problem?
    Or trying to look good?
    Or gain power or status?</p>
<p>Is it a problem or need?
    What emotional jobs?
    Look better
    Feel good
    Feel more secure</p>
<p>What functional or social jobs are getting done?
What emotional jobs?
What basic needs are you helping your customers satisfy?</p>
<p>Chapter 3:
RANK
Rank each job according to its significance to the customer
Crucial or trivial?
At what frequency does it occur?
Outline the context in which a job is done, that may impose constraints
or limitations.</p>
<p>Day in the life
Diagram what a customer does from when they get up and the products they
use and the car they drive etc.</p>
<p>Have a deep understanding of the customer and where your product fits.</p>
<p>On day one you are guessing, the objective is to fill in the day in the
life.</p>
<p>Chapter 4:
customer gains
Benefits the customer expects, desires or would be surprised by.</p>
<p>Besides the jobs they want to get done, what do they want to gain by
using your product or service.</p>
<p>Which savings would make your customer happy?
money, effort, time</p>
<p>What outcomes do they expect and what would go beyond their
expectations?
Quality, more of, less of</p>
<p>Features, performance, quality</p>
<p>What would make your customers job or life easier?
More services, lower cost of ownership, flatter learning curve</p>
<p>depends on selling to business or consumer customers.
You ought to be able to make a list of all the gains that they would get
by using your product.</p>
<p>What positive social consequences do they desire?
Makes them look good, status, increase power, good design, specific or
more features?</p>
<p>How does your customer measure success and failure?
Performance, cost?</p>
<p>What would increase the liklihood of adopting a solution?
lower cost, lower risk, more fun, better quality?</p>
<p>Make that list of hypothesis, and then validate them.</p>
<p>Chapter 5.
Customer pains
Undesired costs and situations, risks, negative emotions</p>
<p>they have been walking around with an arrow through their head and have
been accepting that for a while. But when you come about you say hey we
can solve these problems for you.</p>
<p>What do your customers find too costly?
time   cost</p>
<p>How are current solutions underperforming?
Lack features, performance, malfunctioning</p>
<p>What are the main difficulties and challenges?
Was this problem in the top 3 on their list? In context, what are the
other pains they have even if you're solving a pain. If you're down the
list ask is there any way our product or service can solve what is in
the top 5.</p>
<p>what's keeping your customer awake at night?
Big issues, concerns, worries</p>
<p>What barriers are keeping customers from adopting?
Upfront investment costs
Learning curve
Resistance to change</p>
<p>What makes your customers feel bad?
frustrations
annoyances</p>
<p>What do they fear?
Financial risk
social risk
technical risk - what could go wrong, etc.</p>
<p>You need to understand all of this</p>
<p>Chapter 6.
Customer Persona/Archetype</p>
<p>know everything about those customers.</p>
<p>Not only do you know about the pains and gains of the customers, you
specifically know who they are. </p>
<p>Profile
position/title
age/sex
role
discretionary budget
motivations
Role models</p>
<p>Who are you?
Who do you buy? Where do you buy? How much money do they have to spend?
What matters to you?
Who influences you?</p>
<p>Know how to reach these people and what buttons to push when you do.</p>
<p>Start asking these questions when starting to talk to them trying to
define them. It makes spending for marketing and demand creation and
customer acquisition and activiation incredibly easy because you already
asked them up front how would I get you to by this? Customers already
told you this is how I buy, this is how much I spend, and this is who I
listen to when I make a picture. </p>
<p>Chapter 7.

<p>Chapter 13 - simple two sided google search summary
Multiple customer segments
Each has its own value proposition
each has it's own revenue stream
one segment cannot exist without the other
advertisers have google adwords
web searchers have free search bar</p>
<p>Chapter 26
Actually talking with customers revealed that there were actually two
customer segments. Rabid fans and casual fans</p>
<p>Two customer segments, two value propositions, and a revenue stream that
matches each of the segments.</p>
<p>Archetype needs pains and gains as well -
    is that accurate? Is that confusing? Is it in other BMC's ?</p>
