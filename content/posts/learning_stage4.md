#### Incorporation:

Chapter 1. Value Proposition
What product or service are you building, for who, and what does it
solve for those people?

It's about satisfying a customer need, not just you thinking: "What a
great idea".

Chapter 4. Minimal Viable product

What are the components of a value proposition?
1. The features of your products and services.
2. What gain are you creating for customers?
3. What pain are you solving for them?

What is the smallest possible feature set that solves these pains and
creates gain for them.

The goal is to figure out what the MVP is.


Chapter 9. PRODUCT
Which are part of your value proposition?
-manufacture goods, commodities product ...

Which intangible products are part?
-copyrights, licenses...

Which financial products?
-financial guarantees, insurance policies...

Which digital products?
-mp3 files, ebooks....

The product is the whole package of all the above


Chapter 10. SERVICES
Which core services are part of the value proposition?
-Consulting, a haircut, investment advice...

Which pre-sales or sales services?
-help finding right solution, financing, free-delivery
    services sometimes might seem to be ancillary but actually make your
    products look better than your competitors.

Which after-sales services?
-free maintenance, disposal...

what is it that your product features do?


PAIN KILLERS
What are you going to reduce or eliminate for the customer?

Chapter 12. PAIN KILLERS Hypothesis
Produce savings? Time, money, effort
Feel better? Frustration, annoyance, headaches
Fix solutions? New features, better, faster
End challenges? Easier, eliminate resistance?
Impact social consequences? wipe out negative social
    consequences or add to social status?
Eliminate risk? Financial, social or technical risk 

Chapter 13. PAIN KILLERS Problem or need
Market sizes of needs are multiples of orders of magnitude more than
problems. 

Don't turn every problem into a neeed.


Chapter 14. PAIN KILLERS Ranking
Rank each pain according to their intensity and frequency


GAIN CREATORS
What are the benefits the customer expects, desires or is surprised by?

Chapter 15. GAIN CREATORS Hypothesis
Happy customers? Save time, save money, save effort?
Better outcomes? Better quality, more/less
Exceed current solutions? Features, performance, quality?
Job or life easier?
Create positive consequences? Social (need), business (more sales)


Chapter 16. GAIN CREATORS Ranking
Rank each gain your product and services create according to its
relevance to the customer.

Chapter 17. MVP Physical
Something that customers can touch and feel. 
Always invest a day or two building something tangible.

Chapter 18. MVP Webmovile
Build a "low fidelity" app or website to test the problem. 

This helps you avoid building products that noone wants.

It maximizes the learning per time spent.


Chapter 19. MVP
What product or service you are building your first instance that is
delivered to customers. It is not an alpha or beta.

What is it that customers will tell us that thay will pay for or use
now.

Not a beta, tell customers it's a MVP


Chapter 21. The art of the MVP
It's based on interaction and iteration and understanding customers
needs and pains and gains.

For new markets, don't ask about features, ask "What
solutions are they using"  and "How do they spend their time?"


Chapter 22. COMMON MISTAKES

It's just a feature of someones else's product
"It's nice to have" instead of "got to have"
Not enough customers care


Chapter 23.  QUESTIONS:

Competition:
    What do customers do today? Make BMC's for the competition.

Technology / Market Insight:
    Why is the problem so hard to solve?
    Why is the service not being done by other people?
        Keep asking that question to yourself and to the people you are
        talking to.

Market size:
    How big is this problem? 

Product:
    How do you make it once you understand the customer needs?


Chapter 24: TWO FORMS:

Technology insight:
Typically applies to hardware, clean tech and biotech.

Market insight:
Changes in how people work, live, interact and what they expect.

They both need to solve pains and gains for the customer.


Chapter 25: TYPES

Technology                              Market

More efficient        lower cost     better distribution
smaller               simpler        better bundling
faster                               better branding

The sweet spot in the middle that combines technology and market
insights that makes for a killer value proposition


EXAMPLES OF Value Proposition types:
Technology Insights
Ayasdi - topological analysis, solved previously unapproachable problems
Inscopix - smaller fluorescence microscope - created new market

Market insights
Zynga - play more involved games - facebook distribution
Twitter - micro-blog more than blog - solved a need
zipcar - cars with flexibility - better physical distribution


Chapter 26: JERSEYSQUARE

Pains: cheaper way to wear jersey, eliminate risk of owning traded player
Gain: provide alternative to purchasing counterfeit jersey
Features: single place to rent sports jerseys
MVP: website with rental and stock of jerseys 


Chapter 27: EXAMPLES
OmegaChem
Pain: non-renewable petroleum derived feedstock for surfactant and
lubricant industries

Gains: Sustainable, bio-based replacement.
Higher performance
Improved cold temperature tolerance of detergents, lubricants

Features:
Bi-functional molecules
Flexibility in chain length
Flexibility in branching


CanScan
Pain: Does my patient have CTC's?  How agressive are they?

Features:
Capture and grow CTCs
Video technology to characterize aggressiveness


MammOptics
Pains: Breast cancer diagnosis and deaths
Mammography: 15-25% false negative rate, 25% false positive, requires
x-ray radiation

Features: Earlier detection, non-radiative



We often end up making stuff nobody wants, despite our good ideas and
good intentions. 

Value proposition design eliminates the risk of working on products and
services that don't matter to customers.

We waste resources because we don't test our ideas, but write untested
business plans with polished spread sheets that turn out to be flops.
With value proposition design we eliminate wasting resources by testing
our ideas cheaply when uncertainty is highest - at the beginning of a
project.


The search for a Value proposition involves the design and test
iteratively for what customers really want. It allows you to manage the
messy and nonlinear process and reduces risk by systematically applying
tools and processes.
