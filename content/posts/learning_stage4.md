Chapter 1. Value Proposition
What product or service are you building, for who, and what does it
solve for those people?

It's about satisfying a customer need, not just you thinking: "What a
great idea".

Chapter 4. COMPONENTS

1. The features of your products and services.
2. What gain are you creating for customers?
3. What pain are you solving for them?

The goal is the smallest possible feature set that solves these pains
and creates these gains for the customer. 

That is the Minimally Viable Product.

Chapter 9. PRODUCT
Which are part of your value proposition?
-manufactured goods, commodity product...

Which intangible products are part?
-copyrights, licenses...

Which financial products?
-financial guarantees, insurance policies...

Which digital products?
-mp3 files, ebooks....

The product is the whole package of all the above


Chapter 10. SERVICES
Which core services are part of the value proposition?
-Consulting, a haircut, investment advice...

Which pre-sales or sales services?
-help finding right solution, financing, free-delivery

Which after-sales services?
-free maintenance, disposal...

What is it that your product features do?

**Card deck 4 of 6 MVP **
```
Chapter 19. MVP Definition
The first instance of your product or service that is delivered to
customers. 

What is it that customers tell us that they will pay for or use
right now.

It is not a beta, tell customers it is the MVP.


Chapter 17. MVP Physical
Always invest a day or two building a physical product mockup.
Something that customers can see and touch.

Chapter 18. MVP Webmobile
Build a "low fidelity" app or website to test the problem. 

This helps you avoid building products no one wants.


Chapter 21. The art of the MVP
It's based on interaction and iteration and understanding customers
jobs, pains and gains.

For new markets, don't ask about features, ask "How do they spend their
time?"

Chapter 22. COMMON MISTAKES

It's just a feature of someones else's product
"It's nice to have" instead of "got to have"
Not enough customers care


Chapter 23.  QUESTIONS:

Competition:
    What do customers do today? Make BMC's for the competition.

Technology / Market Insight:
    Why is the problem so hard to solve?
    Why is the service not being done by other people?

Market size:
    How big is this problem? 

Product:
    How do you make it once you understand the customer needs?


Chapter 24: TWO FORMS:

Technology insight:
Typically applies to hardware, clean tech and biotech.

Market insight:
Changes in how people work, live, interact and what they expect.

Both forms need to solve pains and create gains for the customer.


Chapter 25: TYPES
