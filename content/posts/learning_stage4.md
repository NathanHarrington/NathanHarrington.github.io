#### Incorporation:

It's about satisfying a customer need, not just you thinking: "What a
great idea"

Works hand in hand with who your customers are.

The relationship between the value proposition and customers is what
makes startups succeed or fail.

Those two boxes are called: Product market fit
Visualize the canvas and think: Is what I am building needed or wanted
on the customer side? The customer development process allows us to
search without going out of business.


What are the components of a value proposition?
1. The features of your products and services.
2. What gain are you creating for customers?
3. What pain are you solving for them?

It's not just about your product. Look at all these features, and this
is what they can do better and the problems we solve for them.

Understand the minimal viable product. 

what is the smallest possible feature set that solves these pains and
creates gain for them.

An interactive process because you cannot figure it out in your office.
The default is I understand cusotmers problems and needs, don

Real goal is what is the smallest thing you can build or develop that
will get you sales and get out to market as quickly as possible.

The goal of getting out of the building for value proposition
hypothesis testing is Understand gains and pains so you can build the MVP.


PRODUCT
Which are part of your value proposition?
-manufacture goods, commodities product ...
Which intangible products are part?
-copyrights, licenses...
Which financial products?
-financial guarantees, insurance policies...
Which digital products?
-mp3 files, ebooks....

The product is the whole package of all the above

SERVICES
Which core services are part of the value proposition?
-Consulting, a haircut, investment advice...
Which pre-sales or sales services?
-help finding right solution, financing, free-delivery
    services sometimes might seem to be ancillary but actually make your
products look better than your competitors.

Which after-sales services?
-free maintenance, disposal...

what is it that your product features do?


It's also about your PAIN KILLERS
Reduce or eliminate wasted time, costs, negative  emotions, risks.

Produce savings? Time, money, effort
Feel better? Frustration, annoyance, headaches
Fix solutions? New features, better, faster
End challenges? Easier, eliminate resistance?
Impact social consequences? wipe out negative social
    consequences or add to social status?
Eliminate risk? Financial, social or technical risk, or what can go very
wrong?

There might be other things you are solving and taking away pain for
customers. Be able to articulate, based on your interactions outside the
building with customers, here's what they said and when I bounced our
product off of them, they said, yeah, that solves our pain (and more
importantly, is an important pain)

Pain killers - problem or need?
problems
accounting
word->google docs

needs:
entertainment
communication

Market sizes of needs are multiples of orders of magnitude more than
problems. 

Don't turn every problem into a neeed.

apple iphone took a communications device and made it a status symbol.
transitioned from something that solved a problem: phone with integrated
web browser, email. Into now something that people every year obsolete
their own products because it's a need instead of a problem.

Pain killers tactics - ranking
Rank each pain according to their intensity and frequency

A life saving pain, or I've lived with it for years and can live with it
a few more years.
Is it daily or hourly?

Gain creators - how do they create the benefits the customer expects
desires, or is surprised by?

Happy customers? Save time, save money, save effort?
Better outcomes? Better quality, more/less
Exceed current solutions? Features, performance, quality?
Job or life easier?
Create positive consequences? Social (need), business (more sales)

Start with hypothesis, only way to understand this is outside the
building in front of lots of customers.

Gain Creators - ranking
Rank each gain your product and services create according to its
relevance to the customer.

First list is: you got it, gain and pain, i know this because it's my
opinion or becaues i'm a domain expert. At the end of the day your
business is not about your opinion. What you need to do is hear from the
customers: Here's why it's relevant. something like: your product has
this gain for me. Your product solves this intense pain for me. Not you
telling them what gain and pain it solves. The customer telling you.


Second section for MVP
mvp physical - fill these out from the udacity
mvp webmobile

MVP what product/service you are building your first instance that is
delivered to customers. It is not an alpha or beta
Concept -> Dev -> Testing -> Launch
( waterfal development)

                             Buggy/Unfinished product

Not version 1.0 product spec
Talk to customers first
Try to understand what the minimum version of version 1.0
What will they pay for or use now? Not a beta, tell customers it's a MVP

the art of the mvp


Value proposition common mistakes:
It's just a feature of someones else's product
"It's nice to have" instead of "got to have"
    prioritize pains and gains
    they won't let you leave unless they try the prototype

Not enough customers care


Value proposition questions:
Competition: What do cusotmers do today? Make BMC's for the competitors
Why is the problem so hard to solve?
Why is the service not being done by other people?
    Are you hallucinating or is it a breakthrough?
    Keep asking that question to yourself and to the people you are
        talking to?
    Has any body done this? No - ask them why? You might get some
        insight. If they say yeah 8 vendors tried it before: warning,
        you might want to research why that happened.
Market size:
    how big is this problem? 

How do you do it?


Startups have Technology and Market Insight
Technology
moore's law
new scientific discoveries
new algorithms
Typically applies to hardware, clean tech and biotech
Do you have some insight about technology and the pains and gains it can
provide for customers.

Or do you have some insight about market or consumer behavior?
Value chain disruption? Slash cost by 80%
Govt regulation or deregulation going to change and make a new industry
available in ways it never was before.
Changes in how people work, live, interact and what they expect.

they both need to solve pains and gains for the customer.

Types of value propositions
Technology                              Market

More efficient        lower cost     better distribution
smaller               simpler        better bundling
faster                               better branding

sometimes sweet spot in the middle that combines technology and market
insights that makes for a killer value proposition

Technology Insights
Ayasdi

Market insights
Zynga
Twitter
zipcar

Value proposition is three parts
Features, MVP, pains and gains are all the value proposition


Remember, slow way down here - this is rest of your life come back to
this and understand it deeply.




We often end up making stuff nobody wants, despite our good ideas and
good intentions. 

Value proposition design eliminates the risk of working on products and
services that don't matter to customers.

We waste resources because we don't test our ideas, but write untested
business plans with polished spread sheets that turn out to be flops.
With value proposition design we eliminate wasting resources by testing
our ideas cheaply when uncertainty is highest - at the beginning of a
project.


The search for a Value proposition involves the design and test
iteratively for what customers really want. It allows you to manage the
messy and nonlinear process and reduces risk by systematically applying
tools and processes.
