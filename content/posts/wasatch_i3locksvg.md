i3lock has many variations, including
[i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy), the supporting
scripts on
[i3lock-fancy-multimonitor](https://github.com/guimeira/i3lock-fancy-multimonitor)
and many others.

[i3lock-svg](https://github.com/ravinrabbid/i3lock-svg) gives you something truly unique. The ability to fully
customize the unlock characterizations. This is used on wasatch
photonics to create the custom lock screen you see above on linux
systems. Makes quite an impression on customers.
