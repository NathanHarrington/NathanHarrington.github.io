Use the techniques from
[Phidgeter](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/Phidgeter) and the
[Barbecue](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/Barbecue) in an automated
fashion. Perform thousands of power cycle events, and isolate issues
with various software configurations and power requirements.

This tool is used at [Wasatch](http://wasatchphotonics.com) for analysis
of various hardware configurations on Optical Coherence Tomography
systems.
