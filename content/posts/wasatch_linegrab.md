Manufacturing and alignment of spectrometers requires line scan
visualization of camera output. Many vendors provide bare-bones or 
non existent line graphs. LineGrab uses a variety of communication
techniques to provide full-screen line graph visualizations. These
are critical for the precise alignment of spectrometers.

repository for a list of currently supported cameras.
