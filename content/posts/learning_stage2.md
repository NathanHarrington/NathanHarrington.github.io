The surprising thing here was the challenge of refinement of the
lecture materials into a set of one-page groupings. I expected some
difficulty, but the number of iterations and the time required to
select and refine the core concepts was longer than anticipated. This
was the goal however. It was supposed to take however long it took until
you could create memorization entries as part one of incorporation
section of the research, incorporation, and execution cycle.

Also a surprise was the time required to physically write out the cards. 

In addition, it has become evident that the order of the cards provides
a narrative capability that has value. Memorize them in order at first,
then verify the full random order memorization. Random order
memorization is essential for interrogative response. Knowing the cards
backwards and forwards is essential to bridging the gap between
intellectual and intuitive knowledge. However, for certain environments
the full memorization of the cards in order provides a story-based
approach that has unique value.  

Also learned was the documentation of how the one page components were
split out into cards. For ease of re-creation and consistency, the cards
are photographed front and back in order of memorization. If you lose a
card stack or they get out of order, consult the images here for
recreation.
