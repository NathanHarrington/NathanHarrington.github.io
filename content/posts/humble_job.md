Stay humble, or get humbled. - [Jocko Willink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9IZaj-v33o)

I can't find a job. I've done all the postings, I've done all the resume
cleaning. I've applied for dozens of what I thought were good fits. I
had a seriously disappointing number of interviews. I've done it for
months straight, 8 hours per day.

It's like there was a black hole all my work went into.

I feel rejected. I feel terrible.  I never want to apply for a job again.

I need money. I need to pay bills. I am deeply afraid of the
consequences of running out of money. The fear is paralyzing, leading to
inaction where it matters and activity where it doesn't.

Driven to humility, I started the search again. I googled: "example
software engineer resume" without the quotes. The first link from
uptowork.com describes a system to embrace with humility.

[Uptowork software engineer resume](https://uptowork.com/blog/software-engineer-resume)
See this [repository](/content/files/uptowork_resume_guide.txt) for text dump if the link is broken. It's that good.

Read the article - feel the burden lift. Feel that yes you can do this,
you have something to offer. 

Use the tool, make a first pass at a cut and paste replacement of the
descriptions of the various entries. Get encouraged.

Now you know the goal: 

Create a system for testing resumes that work, in order to help others.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Write down the exact steps here. Create a lever you can pull. A series
of instructions so well defined you can outsource the mechanics of the
job search. The goal is not to find a job, the goal is to create a
system for testing resumes that work.

Make this a gift to your future self. For your children. For
anyone who is hurting and has been paralyzed by fear of failure.

You can't be afraid and grateful at the same time. Choose gratitude.
Be grateful that you get this opportunity to write down the tactical and
strategic details of your job search that will help others you love.

Now you're starting to see all of the opportunities staring at you.
They are truly aligned with your skills, you can legitimately have
something to offer.

You're excited again. Don't get bogged down in perfection. The ideal job
is the one that takes the least amount of time. There is no job that is
a substitue for your identity, there is no perfect fit that you must
achieve.


<pre>
Here is the workflow and timelines to follow to keep your momentum
going:

60 minutes: 
    Make a single master resume that lists all of your accomplishments,
    using the templates from the uptowork articles. This is a first pass, not
    an exhaustive list. This is to learn the patterns of production - do not
    get bogged down in making it perfect.

15 minutes: 
    Find one job that looks like a fit. Again, it doesn't have to be a
    perfect fit. The goal at this stage is action.

30 minutes: 
    Make a single master cover letter based on the cover letter tool
    from uptowork:

    Cover letter software engineer:
    https://uptowork.com/blog/software-engineer-cover-letter-example
    Also available in contents/files of this repository

10 minutes: 
    Follow their applicant submission process for the job.

    If it's an email to jobs@company_name.com:

    Subject: 
        (Job Title) - Nathan Harrington
    
    Body:
        Copy and paste from the body of the cover letter.
    
    Attachments: 
        Cover letter.pdf
        Resume.pdf

5 Minutes:

    Create a Tracking document with the columns listed below. Save the file
        as "Job Search with Gratitude.csv"
        Keywords
        Source 
        Company 
        Job Title
        Submitted Date
        Path (email, or ATS)
        Automated Response
        Human Response
        Phone Call
        Skills Test Online
        In Person Interview
        Offer
        Notes                     

</pre>
    
Now as you look at other job opportunities, follow this pattern:

Given a new job posting that looks like a fit:

<pre>
15 minutes: 

    If it's not within daily driving distance, it needs to be a 7/10 fit or
    better to continue this process. You don't want to move, but you don't
    want to waste peoples time either. If it's a very high probably of fit,
    then you would at least seriously consider moving at the end of the
    process. 
    
    Think deeply on your skills and experience. Read the job opportunity and
    decide which of your experiences apply. Add a resume item to the
    master resume that is a reflection of that interplay.  If you're looking
    for ideas, look back through your online profile. Restore old backups.
    Re-immerse yourself in the sights and sounds and the benefits to the
    business that those activities provided.
    
    Creat a single work experience item based on the project. For example,
    if you had a project that took a few months and exactly fit the
    requirements they are looking for, add that as a work experience item on
    the main resume. That is the success they want you to repeat, so give
    that a full 'experience' run down. They want to hear more details about
    exactly the work you have done that will help them. This will rapdily
    fill the master resume with a wide variety of projects that you have
    worked on, in detail.
    
    Add a start and end date in year, do not include months

30 minutes: 
    Do something else not job search related - anything else.
    This is critical to break you out of the perfection-inaction loop.

15 minutes: 
    Clone the master resume.
    Change the resume title to have the job title in it
    Change the personal info->Profession to be the job title
    Change the summary to be tailored to the job description. 
    Remove any non-relevant parts of the experience
        that are not tailed to this job. Choose just the work descriptions from
        each company that apply. Delete the rest.
    Update the skills section to match the job posting.
    Only spend 15 minutes on this. 
    You must complete this in 15 minutes.
    Again, it's ok if its not perfect. The goal is to break out of the
        depression-induced inaction cycle.

    Download the PDF, save as:
        FirstName_LastName_JobTitle_Resume.pdf
        for example:
        Nathan_Harrington_Scientific_Applications_Resume.pdf

15 minutes: 
    Clone the master cover letter.
    Change the cover letter title to be:
        Job Title 

    Change the "profession" to match the job title.

    Update the contents of the cover letter to match the job
        description.

    Save as:
        FirstName_LastName_JobTitle_Cover_Letter.pdf
        for example:
        Nathan_Harrington_Process_Engineer_Cover_Letter.pdf


10 minutes: 

    Follow their applicant submission process for the job.
    If it's an email to jobs@company_name.com:

    Subject: 
        (Job Title) - Nathan Harrington
    
    Body:
        Copy and paste from the body of the cover letter.
    
    Attachments: 
        Cover letter.pdf
        Resume.pdf

1 Minute:

    Update the job tracking sheet

</pre>

As you iterate through these steps, remember the goals:

1. Collect data on which resumes work for which jobs.
2. Create a system that you can operate that you can share with your
future self, and anyone who needs it.
3. Record the successes and the failures.
4. Proceed in gratitude.


Does this work?
---------------

I followed the instructions above and had immediate positive results.
The language and the layout updates to the resume as recommended by
uptowork.com are a powerful differentiator.  That's not the point. The
point is to repeat this to collect enough data and get familiar with it.
To write down the nuances of what it really takes to have good results. 

Never struggle again. Never fail at this again. 

Your professional training is not your identity. Fill yourself with
gratefulness that you can use this process to help others. You're not
struggling as punishment, it's training so you can help others.
