The main problem is using google calendar and email as a task management system.

Goals:
1. Clear priorities
2. Un-encumbering task list
3. Zero data loss of written tasks.
4. Single place where all tasks are stored
5. Calendar is for scheduling events only.
6. Email is for communication only


Given this example email processing workflow:


What this is immediately showing is that hyper-task management is not
the same as productivity. What the real problem is is you let yourself
become task saturated. You know what works the best. Full elimination of
everything that does not address the immediate, most important, and life
changing goal. Creating, organizing and giving away businesses.

Now how does task warrior help you do that?


Task warrior provides a faster mechanims for writing notes.
task add "read innovators dilemma"

vs. 

create draft in google mail web app, go to body, write "read innovators
dilemma",

create event in google calendar
(pick an appropriate day based on arbitrary rules)
add "read innovators dilemma" as the title, click save

The lesson here is that it's really about the workflow first, then tool
selection. You thought taskwarrior would fix the problems. What it does
is help you elucidate what the problem is.

For example:
Phone call, sharing ideas, written on piece of paper.
Come back next day, write them out as separate tasks like:
task add "find anne mcgraf book"
task add "research kellogg innovation forum"


That is just the 'storage' component of this procedure. The second level
procedure is you need a task management workflow, just like you have for
email.
