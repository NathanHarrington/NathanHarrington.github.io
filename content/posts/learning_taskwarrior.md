The main problem is using google calendar and email as a task management system.

Goals:
1. Clear priorities
2. Un-encumbering task list
3. Zero data loss of written tasks.
4. Single place where all tasks are stored
5. Calendar is for scheduling events only.
6. Email is for communication only


Given this example email processing workflow:


What this is immediately showing is that hyper-task management is not
the same as productivity. What the real problem is is you let yourself
become task saturated. You know what works the best. Full elimination of
everything that does not address the immediate, most important, and life
changing goal. Creating, organizing and giving away businesses.

Now how does task warrior help you do that?
