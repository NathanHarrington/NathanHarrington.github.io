The main problem is using google calendar and email as a task management system.

Goals:

1. Clear priorities

2. Un-encumbering task list

3. Zero data loss of written tasks.

4. Single place where all tasks are stored

5. Calendar is for scheduling events only.

6. Email is for communication only


Given this example email processing workflow:


What this is immediately showing is that hyper-task management is not
the same as productivity. What the real problem is is you let yourself
become task saturated. You know what works the best. Full elimination of
everything that does not address the immediate, most important, and life
changing goal. Creating, organizing and giving away businesses.

Now how does task warrior help you do that?


Task warrior provides a faster mechanims for writing notes.
task add "read innovators dilemma"

vs. 

create draft in google mail web app, go to body, write "read innovators
dilemma",

create event in google calendar
(pick an appropriate day based on arbitrary rules)
add "read innovators dilemma" as the title, click save

The lesson here is that it's really about the workflow first, then tool
selection. You thought taskwarrior would fix the problems. What it does
is help you elucidate what the problem is.

For example:
Phone call, sharing ideas, written on piece of paper.
Come back next day, write them out as separate tasks like:
task add "find anne mcgraf book"
task add "research kellogg innovation forum"


That is just the 'storage' component of this procedure. The second level
procedure is you need a task management workflow, just like you have for
email.

You don't want to get things done. You don't want to write down,
classify and then track as much work as possible. You want to eliminate
as much work as possible in order to focus on what you are here for.

As you pay the bills this morning, think of how you can use task warrior
to augment the elimination of work. Follow the bill paying process, yes,
but eliminate at least one recurring task.

## Pay someone to mow your lawn.

This was arguably the single most transformative event in my day to day
life I have ever done. It transformed an obligation into an opportunity.
What else are you doing becuase you 'have to'? A workflow for mowing the
lawn is something like:

Is it Wednesday?
Is it prime growing season?
    Yes 
        Was the lawn mowed within past 7 days?
    No
        Was the lawn mowed withing past 14 days?

Does the mower work?
Is their fuel available?

Does the trimmer work?
Is their line available?

Does the blower work?
Are teh batteries charged?

Then budget out 2 hours of a day to prepare, mow, and cleanup.

This is really a small portion of the overall thought effort you were
giving to this task. Externally it looks like 'mow the lawn'. Where you
spend 2 hours on a Saturday or whatever day happens to work when it is
not raining. When you dive down, you see that it's really 3-4 hours of
total time per week. Moreover, the thought burden requires task
switching and planning and physical presence.

Now it's you spend 150$ a month, and you never think about it. You come
home and the lawn is mowed and you never have to worry about it. You
can leave at any time. This is what you want task warrior to help with.
This is what you want out of the bill paying procedure. What would you
do if you never had to worry about money? You would create, organize and
give away businesses.


## Pay someone to pay your bills

If you're not living month to month, if there is some margin, setup
autopay. That will eliminate a huge portion. Then you digitize
everything. If you never have to check the mail, you then have a
non-physical presence required approach. Then to test you put some money
in a separate account at a separate bank. You have one job every month,
put X thousands for paying the bills in that account. You workflow the
entire procedure, then you outsource it. Then you audit it once a week,
then every two weeks, then every month, then you're bill paying
requirements go from hours a week to minutes every month. Moreover, you
brain is freed from the overhead.
