Web application to display Wasatch Photonics device information and
calibration reports.


Allows for the easy communication of device specific information to the
customer, regardless of location. Previous integration systems used
dropbox, google, or baidu. These are frequently banned by IT departments
or entire geographical networks. The CookBook is a fully tested web
application designed to get around these limitations. It's also
specifically designed to address the Wasatch Photonics workflow. Uses
the [Authomatic](http://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic/) library for
oauth with Google apps for business. This allows authenticated users to
create entries, post updated content, etc. External users have
unrestricted access to the device information, drastically simplifying
their remote support requirements.

Full source code and implementation instructions available on: [Github](http://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/CookBook).
