A custom interface for [AnalyzeIQ Lab](https://www.analyzeiq.com/Products/Analyze-IQ-Lab.html) that will collect data from Wasatch Photonics devices.
Analyze IQ is a third party chemometrics solution that can
also be used on
[Ventana](http://oceanoptics.com/product-category/ventana-series/) devices from [Ocean
Optics](http://oceanoptics.com/product/analyze-iq-chemistry-software/)
        
Acquires data from Wasatch Photonics
spectrometers, write out in xml format for use in AnalyzeIQ.
This uses AnalyzeIQ's stdin/stdout interface, which is more than
sufficient for multiple acquisitions per second. Pleasingly
straightforward to integrate and test.
