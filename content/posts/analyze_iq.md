<!-- Why is this hidden? 

As a syntax reminder for how you can apparently embed html in this file,
with markdown inside of it. See the spae after the first row below for
further comments.

            A custom interface for [AnalyzeIQ Lab](https://www.analyzeiq.com/Products/Analyze-IQ-Lab.html) that will collect data from Wasatch Photonics devices.
            Analyze IQ is a third party chemometrics solution that can
            also be used on
            [Ventana](http://oceanoptics.com/product-category/ventana-series/) devices from [Ocean
            Optics](http://oceanoptics.com/product/analyze-iq-chemistry-software/)

        Acquires data from Wasatch Photonics
        spectrometers, write out in xml format for use in AnalyzeIQ.
        This uses AnalyzeIQ's stdin/stdout interface, which is more than
        sufficient for multiple acquisitions per second. Pleasingly
        straightforward to integrate and test.
