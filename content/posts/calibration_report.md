Web service to create calibration reports for wasatch photonics
spectrometers. Use a responsive web form to accept a serial

Live demo available at [waspho.com](http://waspho.com:8081/).
This is used by the [CookBook](http://waspho.com) spectrometer
tracking system. This was the first system created as part of
the microwave/cookbook update. Uses travis and coveralls for
continuous integration testing. Deployed on a [Digital Ocean
