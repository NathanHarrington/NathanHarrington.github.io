Make sure to view the entire canvas here - there are sticky notes
'outside' the document.

Research notes for the search for 'one page':

use sticky notes, no pens or pencils allowed
your guesses are probably wrong

As we find the insights we will change the canvas by marking it up as we
gather data, test hypothesis and gain insight.

Market opportunity/analysis
business model canvas is one tool, in the continuum of zoom in/out of
the business tool set. 

A good business model canvas stays within it's boundaries.

Sketch out new business ideas or visualize existing businesses.

A shared language to have better strategic conversations.
Individually used to structure your thinking.

What does it look like visually:
B0 canvas poster: 1.4 x 1 meter
XLarge statty's 8.5 x11 would be way too big
Probably want "small" statty's which are 10 x7 cm which fits with the
various visualizations
standard size 3x3 post it notes should be fine as well.

Use an existing white board and draw it up.
Use some sticky notes with different colors. 
Make some draft business model canvases at different sizes. Do it on
8.5x11 canvas with tiny notes
Add pictures 
Make it huge and buy the huge sticky notes like on the first page 3 of
the busines smodel canvas instruction manual

Ground rules:
Don't write on the canvas: Keep things flexible with mobile ideas. move
things on and off the canvas

One idea per statty
Don't make bullet points on status. Use two sticky notes to describe two
differetn channels. Like sales for and your companys website. This
allows you to play around with the elements of your business model. 

it's supposed to be dynamic. It's supposed to include play.

Meta -bmc
the business model canvas is shaped by four areas:
Market Forces, Key Trends, Industry Forces and Macro-Economic trends

Left is industry forces, Top is key trends, right is market forces,
bottom is macro-economic trends 

What are the immediate impactors as we zoom out from the business model
canvas? The four forces - focus on the top level for now, and be aware
that they are hugely impactful at defining the components of the
business model canvas. The canvas is just a tool in the chain of
understanding for the business. Zooming in gives us customer development
and agile engineering.

The question is what level of incorporation do you need to include at
this stage. Do you memorize just the top level of each of the four areas
that shape the  business model canvas? Or do you stay focused for now on
the fact that it fits in the continuum and how.

Notice the business model canvas has very short descriptions and
iconography


go through the google doc business model canvas template and make it
match the concepts from instructions on tool usage. For example,
eliminate the portions where you can write directly on the canvas.
Remove the questions from the various canvas parts. Add instructions for
staying disciplined to the instructions and never changing the stickies.
Can you add a write-once sticky to google docs?
