#### Incorporation:
**Card deck one of two: Meta Business Model Canvas**
```
The business model canvas is just one tool.
It has a place in the continuum of broad view and narrowly focused
resources for modelling businesses.

The business model canvas is shaped by four areas:
Left is industry forces, Top is key trends, right is market forces,
bottom is macro-economic trends 

Zooming in gives us customer development and agile engineering.

A good business model canvas stays within it's boundaries.

Sketch out new business ideas or visualize existing businesses.

Used corporately as shared language to have better strategic conversations.

Individually used to structure your thinking.

Ground rules for physical and virtual canvases:
Don't write on the canvas. 
Keep things flexible with mobile ideas on stickys.
Move things on and off the canvas.
Include text and imagery on each sticky.

Do not use a white board, as it will encourage writing on the canvas
directly, diluting it's effectiveness.

As we find insights, we will change the canvas by moving stickys off or
adding new ones.


One idea per sticky
Don't make bullet points on stickys. 
Use two sticky notes to describe two different concepts. 
    Like physical store sales and your companys web-store.

It is supposed to be dynamic.
This approach allows you to play with the elements of the business model
    to gain understanding.

Use these same concepts for physical and virtual canvases

Whether a paper on the wall or the business model canvas fiddle, follow
the same concepts of what makes a good business model canvas.

## Execution:

Print out many of the business model canvases, then draw your
iconagraphy and start populating based on the questions at the current
level. Don't worry about perfection, but do start with a real value
proposition you want to test. Do focus on meeting the standards of the
tool. That is, don't dig deep into the business model canvas book or the
value proposition detailed questions yet. Stay focused on just the
highest level for right now, then stage 4 and 5 will allow you to get
hyper focused when you are ready.

Here is a [simple SVG business model
canvas](../images/learning/business_model_canvas_template.svg) created in inkscape. It will
not print correctly from inkscape, but looks close enough when printed
from Firefox on linux to a HP OfficeJet PRO X576DW MFP.

Lessons learned:

Meta-BMC cards took 10 minutes for straight through memorization
What makes a good BMC cards to 27 minutes for straight through
memorization

It's so powerful. It's so encouragingly effective. Actually went through
this research, incorporation stages, and I am transformed through the
study and knowledge. Now for the execution part. Now to make a business
model canvas according to the known effective execution materials from
the Steve Blank resources:
