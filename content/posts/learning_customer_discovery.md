**Card deck 1 of 2 Develop an interview Plan**
```
Abstract assumptions
Generate a list of questions based on your customer segment
assumptions.
Abstract your questions to disguise what you would otherwise ask
directly.
Don't ask questions in a manner that can influence a customer's
response.

Industry Research
Become an expert.
Search for industry report, establish Google alerts, read scholarly
articles, etc.
It's not hard to know more than the person across from you about
generalized industry trends.

Company Research
Read the companies website.

Person Research
Read their linkedin profile
From the companies website, read their biography.

Starter Questions
Build rapport by mentioning something you have discovered from the
company website or the personal research.

Conversation Prompts
If the conversation stalls, fall back to:
yeah, but why did (the last thing they said)
that's interesting, but how (the last thing they said)

Keep communication open
Develop a reference story and write a highly professional email getting
right to the ASK (which is an interview)

Sample Interview Questions
Can you tell me a story about that?
And then what happened?
Why/how did you do that?

What did you love/hate  about that?
If you could have a magic wand, what would it be like?
Can you tell me about the experience when ...

What are the best/worts parts about ...
Can you help me understand more about ...

Practice 
Rehearse the opening approach. The start of the interview, the
conversation prompts, and the end ask.

**Card deck 2 of 2 Conducting Interviews**
```

Customer discovery is an art
An intuitive process that relies on your ability to recognize
common themes expressed by others. 

Honesty
You have to posses the self control, objectivity and realism to be
honest about whether your value proposition can meet their needs or fix
their problems.

Genuine interest
Demonstrate that you are authentically trying to deliver a solution
that will eliminate "pains" or create "gains" for the customer. 

Actually talking with customers
The interviews are for gaining empathy and surfacing insight.
Ask questions to seek understanding, not to sell an idea.

Listen
Forget about yourself. 
Be completely optimisitic and open to listening to the needs of your
customers.

Seek Stories
Find in-depth stories about a users experiences that touch their
emotions.

Ask "Why" and "How"
As you are listening to stories and hear them express a point, always
dig deeper and ask why. Ask simple, penetrating inquiries to get them to
to describe a deeper need which they may not have understood initially.

Immersion - There is simply no better way to gain empathy for a problem
a customer experiences than actually living through their experience.

Observation - Ask them to physically demonstrate how they are currently
solving a problem. Have them draw the process flow of how they are
currently performing a specific job.


Customer doorways
Bold statements
Inconsistency between what they say and do
Sudden, animated gestures
Silence

Go through the customer doorway and probe further by asking how and why.



Known market 
Problem Presentation
Describe your assumed list of problems, pause and ask the customers what
they think the problems are. Where you are missing any problems.

Unknown market 
Seek stories
People don't always understand their own problem.
Find specific stories about their day to day experiences.

A single message left behind:
Leave them with the feeling that you are genuinely interested in helping
solve their pains and give them gains. 
It doesn't matter if they never see the prototype as long as they feel
that you are trying to help.
