Clickable, navigatable demonstration of the new user experience design
for OCT Angiography. No actual OCT processing is included. See the
screenshots below for more detail. One of the primary goals of this
system was to create a 'live' demo for faster iteration of design
concepts. This demo was based on the [PySideApp](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/PySideApp)

Uses QT Designer (Qt4), and various styles, layouts and layering to get
the desired effects, with much better portability than previous
iterations. The
[BlueGraph](http://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/BlueGraph) techniques,
for example, were heavily influenced by GraphicsView systems with
layered SVG controls, that had embedded PNGs. This was fast, and
would let you do various graphics effects, at the expense of
development time.
