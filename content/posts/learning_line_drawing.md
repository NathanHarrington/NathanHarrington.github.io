## Meta Business Model Canvas
The business model canvas is just one tool.
It has a place in the continuum of wide angle and narrowly focused
resources for modelling businesses.

A good business model canvas stays within it's boundaries.

Sketch out new business ideas or visualize existing businesses.

Used corporately as shared language to have better strategic conversations.

Individually used to structure your thinking.

The business model canvas is shaped by four areas:
Market Forces, Key Trends, Industry Forces and Macro-Economic trends

Left is industry forces, Top is key trends, right is market forces,
bottom is macro-economic trends 

The canvas is just a tool in the chain of
understanding for the business. Zooming in gives us customer development
and agile engineering.

## What makes a good business model canvas?

What are the components?
Coarse grained visual indicators:
A large rectangle, suitable for the environment and the participants.

[Regular size 3x3" post it notes](

[Black only, standard sharpie](

Use sticky notes, no writing on the canvas allowed.
Your guesses are probably wrong.

As we find insights, we will change the canvas by moving stickys off or
adding new ones.

Use blue painters tape to attach the canvas to the wall. Do not use a
white board to even draw the canvas, as it will have it's effectiveness
diluted by writing on the canvas directly.

Ground rules:
Don't write on the canvas. 
Keep things flexible with mobile ideas. 
Move things on and off the canvas

One idea per sticky
Don't make bullet points on stickys. 
Use two sticky notes to describe two different concepts. 
    Like physical store sales and  your companys website.
This allows you to play around with the elements of your business model. 
It's supposed to be dynamic. It's supposed to include play.

Notice the business model canvas PDF has very short descriptions and
iconography. Each description is on one line, and it has simple
iconagraphy. It does not include the full list of questions that let you
populate the canvas.

Whatever tool you use, whether the google doc template or the business
model canvas fiddle, follow the same concepts of what makes a good
business model canvas.



----- See the 'learn to draw' section for details on how to communicate
visually for developing artists. ----


There is deep value in hand drawing iconagraphy as well to provide that
text+visualization communication method. The icons provided seem
ill-suited for hand re-creation. Searching for a set of line drawings
that you can learn to help with this communication.

You don't need a set of sophisticated imagery and a skilled hand at
communicating any concept. You do need to have just the iconagraphy
practiced for the components of the business model canvas so you can
demonstrate the value of imagery. Spend time praticing outline drawn
versions of the iconagraphy from the strategyzer business model canvas. 

why is this required? Because the strategyzer Key Activities icon is:


And that takes a long time and unusual skill to hand draw.
An easier image to draw in the real life context of people waiting and
watching is:


See the image below for the full outline imagery to practice:


Core concepts from the [creativeblog guide](
http://www.creativebloq.com/illustration/how-draw-basic-shapes-31619534) that seem to immediately improve line drawing quality:

>Draw with the arm, not with the fingers.
>Position the utensil like writing, but move the arm, don't articulate
>the joints of the phalanges.
>Pull the utensil.

>Pre-visualize: pinpoint your start point, imagine the end point.
>Pull your mark along the imagined path removing the pencil once it
>reaches the end point.


All that seems needed for this juncture is a basic level of skill and
knowledge of what to draw. Don't try and make it up during the BMC
generation, know ahead of time a series of line drawings that you have
practiced. Starting for now with the imagery above.
