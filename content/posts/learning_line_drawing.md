## Learn to draw for communication

There is deep value in hand drawing iconagraphy as well to provide that
text+visualization communication method. The icons provided by
strategyzer and others seem ill-suited for hand re-creation by
developing artists.

You don't need a set of sophisticated imagery and a skilled hand at
communicating any and all concepts. You do need to have just the
iconagraphy practiced for the components of the business model canvas so
you can demonstrate the value of imagery. Spend time praticing outline
drawn versions of the iconagraphy from the strategyzer business model
canvas. 

Why is this required? Because the strategyzer Key Activities icon is:


And that takes a long time and unusual skill to hand draw.
An easier image to draw in the real life context of people waiting and
watching is:


See the image below for the full outline imagery to practice:


Follow the core concepts from the [creativebloq guide](

that immediately imporve the quality and repeatability of the line
drawings:

>Draw with the arm, not with the fingers.
>Position the utensil like writing, but move the arm, don't articulate
>the joints of the phalanges.
>Pull the utensil.

>Pre-visualize: pinpoint your start point, imagine the end point.
>Pull your mark along the imagined path removing the pencil once it
>reaches the end point.

All that seems needed for this juncture is a basic level of skill and
knowledge of what to draw. Don't try and make it up during the BMC
generation, know ahead of time a series of line drawings that you have
practiced. Use variations on what you know and have practiced for line
drawing iconagraphy. The point is to visually communicate as it is more
efficient at conveying the ideas. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just
needs to be a good enough reproduction to facilitate understanding
instead of causing people to ask "What is that supposed to be?".
