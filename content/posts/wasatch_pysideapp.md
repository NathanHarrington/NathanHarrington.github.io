Minimal application demonstrating core features for deployable
applications


What I always wished I had the time to develop earlier. Multiprocessing
that is tested. Log setups that spawn processes and all messages go to
the same file. MVC architecture with separately tested components. 

Fully automated application builds on windows, including
the installer. This is the basis for a wide range of next generation app
for Wasatch photonics, including:

[MicroAngio UX Demo](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/MicroAngio)

[FastPM100](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/FastPM100)

AutoFallOff (in progress)

Dash4 - The next revision of the [Dash spectrometer control](http://devices.wasatchphotonics.com/) software.


This application is designed to meet one of Wasatch's primary use cases:
rapid acquisition of data from devices, with visualization.
