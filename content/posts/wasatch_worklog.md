Document at a high level each of the main tasks for that work day at
Wasatch. Provide a series of time, effort and control metrics for
finding the most efficient mechanisms to move forward.

This page is the meta description of the effort. The actual work log
will be recorded in the [Wasatch Timeline](/pages/wasatch-work-log-timeline.html)
