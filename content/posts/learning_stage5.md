**Card deck 1 of 6 Overview**

Customer segments
GOAL: A deep understanding of the customer persona.

Persona starts with:
What functional, social or emotional job is the customer performing?
What pains do they have?
What gains do they want?

Provide answers to the questions:
Who are they, why would they buy, why won't they buy. What do you need
to say to them?
```

**Card deck 3 of 6 Pains**
```
Pains
Anything that prevents your customers from getting a job done.
Can annoy customers before, during and after trying to get a job done.
Or describes risks related to getting a job done badly or not at
all.

1. Cost
Takes a lot of time, too much money, or requires substantial efforts?

2. Feel 
What are their frustrations, annoyances, or things that give them a
headache?

3. Performance 
What features are they missing? What performance issues annoy them or
malfunctions do they cite?

4. Challenges
Do they not understand how things work, have difficulties getting
certain things done, or resist particular jobs for specific reasons?

5. Social consequences
Are they afraid of losing face, power, trust or status?

6. Risks
Are there financial, social, or technical risks. Or are they asking
themselves what could go wrong?

7. Anxiety
What are their big issues, concerns and worries?

8. Mistakes
Are they using a solution the wrong way? What common mistakes do
customers make?

9. Barriers
Are their upfront investment costs, a steep learning curve, or other
obstacles preventing adoption?

Make pains concrete
"Waiting in line for 10 minutes is a waste" 
is better than
"I hate standing in line"

Pain severity
A customer pain can be extreme or moderate, similar to how jobs can be
important or insignificant to the customer.

**Card deck 4 of 6 Gains**
```
Gains are benefits the customer expects, desires or would be surprised
by. Gains include functional utility, social gains, positive emotions,
and cost savings.

1. Savings
Which time, money and effort reductions would they value. 

2. Quality
What would they wish more or less of? What quality levels do they
expect?

3. Existing features
What specific performance do they expect? How can you improve those
features?

4. Easier
A flatter learning curve, more services, or lower costs of ownership?

5. Positive social consequences
What increases their power or status? What makes them look good?

6. Seeking most
Are they searching for good design, guarantees, specific or more
features?

7. Feel better
What do they aspire to achieve, or what would be a big relief to them?

8. Measurements
How does your customer gauge performance or cost? How do they measure
success and failure?

9. Obstacles
What would increase the likelihood of adopting a solution?
Lower cost, lower risk, more fun, better quality?


Make gains concrete
"Performs 10 minutes faster"
is better than
"Increased performance"


Rank your gains
A customer gain can feel essential or nice to have. Make sure you are
focusing on the most important gains to the customer
