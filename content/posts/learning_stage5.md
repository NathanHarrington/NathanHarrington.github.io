#### Incorporation:

Customer segments definition:

A deep understanding of the customer persona.

Persona starts with:
What functional or social jobs?
What emotional jobs?
What gains are we providing the customer?
What pains are we solving?

Provide answers to the questions:
Who are they, why would they buy, why won't they buy. What do you need
to say to them?



A customer job could be the tasks they are trying to perform and
complete, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are
trying to satisfy.

Functional jobs
Perform a specific task to solve a specific problem.
Mow the lawn
Eat healthy
write a report

Social jobs
These jobs describe how customers want to be perceived by others
Look good or gain power or status
Look trendy
Be seen as competent

Personal/emotional jobs
Customer seeks a specific emotional state
Feel good or secure
Seeking peace of mind regarding investments


Rank each job according to its significance to the customer
Crucial or trivial?
At what frequency does it occur?

Outline the context in which a job is done, that may impose constraints
or limitations.


Pains
Anything that prevents your customers from getting a job done.
Can annoy customers before, during and after trying to get a job done.
Also can describe risks related to getting a job done badly or not at
all.

1. Cost
Takes a lot of time, too much money, or requires substantial efforts?

2. Feel bad
What are their frustrations, annoyances, or things that give them a
headache?

3. Performance 
What features are they missing? What performance issues annoy them or
malfunctions do they cite?

4. Challenges
Do they understand how things work, have difficulties getting certain
things done, or resist particular jobs for specific reasons?

5. Social consequences
Are they afraid of losing face, power, trust or status?

6. Risks
Financial, social, or technical risks. Or are they asking themselves what
could go wrong?

7. Anxiety
What are their big issues, concerns and worries?

8. Mistakes
Are they using a solution the wrong way? What common mistakes do
customers make?

9. Barriers
Are their upfront investment costs, a steep learning curve, or other
obstacles preventing adoption?

Make pains concrete
"Waiting in line for 10 minutes is a waste" 
is better than
"Waiting in line is a waste"


Pain severity
A customer pain can be extreme or moderate, similar to how jobs can be
important or insignificant to the customer.




Gains are benefits the customer expects, desires or would be surprised
by. Gains include functional utility, social gains, positive emotions,
and cost savings.

1. Savings
Which time, money and effort reductions would they value. 

2. Quality
What would they wish more or less of? What quality levels do they
expect?

3. Existing features
What specific performance do they expect? How can you improve those
features?

4. Easier
A flatter learning curve, more services, or lower costs of ownership?

5. Positive social consequences
What increases their power or status? What makes them look good?

6. Seeking most
Are they searching for good design, guarantees, specific or more
features?

7. Feel better
What do they aspire to achieve, or what would be a big relief to them?

8. Measurements
How does your customer gauge performance or cost? How do they measure
success and failure?

9. Obstacles
What would increase the likelihood of adopting a solution?
Lower cost, lower risk, more fun, better quality?


Make gains concrete
"Performs 10 minutes faster"
is better than
"Increased performance"


Rank your gains
A customer gain can feel essential or nice to have. Make sure you are
focusing on the most important gains to the customer



Customer Persona
Not only do you know about the pains and gains of the customers, you
specifically know who they are.  Know everything about those customers.

Profile Components
position or title
demographics
role
discretionary budget
motivations
Role models

Profile questions:
Who are you?
Who do you buy? 
Where do you buy? 
How much money do they have to spend?
What matters to you?
Who influences you?

Day in the life
Diagram what a customer does from when they get up and the products they
use and the car they drive etc.

Have a deep understanding of the customer and where your product fits.
