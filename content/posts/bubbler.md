The Bubbler has been re-created. Thank you Ryan and Allison for making
it memorable. 

The original bubbler was based on [os-viseffects](/posts/real-time-visual-effects.html). 
                                                                                                                                                 
 Game design:                                                                                                                                    
     Get the highest score possible in the time allotted. Every gameplay decision                                                                
 is based on the idea that most kids enjoying gaming the system as much as the                                                                   
 gameplay itself. That's why the mess bubbles time out. That's why it's harder to                                                                
 get a high score by just leaving your arm visible to the window. Game scores are                                                                
 not recorded anywhere to encourage spectators to track the highest score, as                                                                    
 well as establishing classes of ability - if you're a huge adult, it's harder to                                                                
 avoid the bubbles - but it's easier to hit the blue ones too.
