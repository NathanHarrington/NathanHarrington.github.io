One pager:

The search for software value propositions customers can't resist,
embedded in profitable and scalable business models.

How are we going to do that? The business model canvas.

What will be the result?
A new idea shaped by the business model canvas that is profitable and
will compliment the processes currently in place to run the business.
Target date is 20171231. Profitability in this context includes letters
of intent or (preferrably) actual transactions.

What are you tactics used to achieve this:
Perform the research, incorporation, execution cycle for each stage.

Stage 1: program overview (everything on this one page)

Stage 2: What was done, what we know now.
    This includes the top level business model canvas

Stage 3: Meta-BMC - what makes a good business model canvas?

Stage 4: Value propositions

Stage 5: Customer segments

Stage 6: Customer discovery and product market fit

Stage 7: Test assumptions, Gather data, gain insights, repeat




2017-09-15 07:34 first half of what we know now card stack from
education through strategy took 25 minutes for initial pass memorization
second half in 13 minutes
combined review: 2:45 first pass correct

So 40 minutes for 11 cards (not counting the writing of the cards, that
was done separately yesterday

Third component 'what is a business model' took 19 minutes

Now stating full random order verification, where if you get any card
wrong, you go put it 2 down in the stack until you get it right. Then
you can go back to the one pagers and put them in order if necessary.
The point is to otruly understand them and be able to flow through the
self talk stage with random queues about your circumstances and goals.


Starting stage 3: Meta-bmc. What makes a good business model canvas
