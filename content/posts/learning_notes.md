2017-09-15 07:34 first half of what we know now card stack from
education through strategy took 25 minutes for initial pass memorization
second half in 13 minutes
combined review: 2:45 first pass correct

So 40 minutes for 11 cards (not counting the writing of the cards, that
was done separately yesterday

Third component 'what is a business model' took 19 minutes

Now stating full random order verification, where if you get any card
wrong, you go put it 2 down in the stack until you get it right. Then
you can go back to the one pagers and put them in order if necessary.
The point is to otruly understand them and be able to flow through the
self talk stage with random queues about your circumstances and goals.
