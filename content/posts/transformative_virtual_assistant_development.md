You are busy. You are valuable to the organization. There are things
that you are uniquely good at. This process will help you focus on those
things. Invest in freeing your time, and reap huge benefits as your
productivity increases through the systemization of your repetitive
tasks.

Goal: Create a transformative experience that increases your productivity 80%.

For any information related task, find a mechanism to discover
information workers, assign the work, and get 80% of the quality of
results in 20% of the time of doing each step manually yourself.

There are many resources espousing the benefits and mechanisms for
finding a virtual assistant. Some of the best:

[4HWW] (https://tim.blog/2010/11/02/virtual-assistants/)
[Outsource Entrepreneur] (https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245561)

This document is about the specific tactics used to find a virtual
assistant to help with biotechnology research related tasks. The main
assumption to be tested is that the search, identification and collation
of data can be outsourced. The first step is to identify a goal, and
then walk through each portion of the creation step manually. Then, once
the variation in research paths has been reduced to a known set of
states, (including an 'unknown' state), apply quantification metrics to
each end state.  Communicate the exact process to potential candidates,
and then evaluate their performance quantitatively.

Here's a quick example of what *not* to do:

Go into a local life sciences research library funded by the state's
biotech program. Ask for help finding market research reports on
diffraction gratings. Watch as they type in 'defraction grading' into a
life sciences database search tool and get zero results.

This is not their fault - this is your fault. This is an under
specification of search requirements, coupled with poor communication on
your part.

A better example is:
Search google for "diffraction grating" with quotes
Click the company page
Click products
Find any diffraction grating
    none available? -> Go to next google result
    At least one available?
        Create a new google doc for that company
        Append every diffraction grating specification of size, lpmm,
        center wavelength and cost on a new row in the google
        spreadsheet
        
        Add the company name to the main diffraction grating research
        document.

        Add a link to the company specific google doc to the main
        diffraction grating research document.

Understand that this level of verbosity is not demeaning. This
specification of exact work products and steps to achieve them is
exactly what is required for effective collaboration. They have deep,
valuable skills in interpreting difficult to read web pages and
understanding where to find the information you are looking for.
Leverage their capabilities by first establishing a highly detailed set
of rules for building a shared language of activities.

The goal here is to eliminate the task as a variable. You're looking to
refine your candidates by spending approximately 500$ and 80 hours
collectively. What you're testing here is not your ability to write a
coherent task, but rather which candidates can communicate effectively
immediately.  Then you take it to phase two where you interview them in
person and share more of the strategic direction to see what level of
insight they can provide.


Details for actual posting on upwork.com

Go on upwork.com

For example:
Find businesses that make volume phase holographic transmission
gratings.



Day 1: Post job, invite candidates
Day 2: Screen candidate responses
Day 3: Screen candidate responses, evalute estimates
Day 4: Screen candidate responses, evalute estimates
Day 5: Qualify results

The goal here is at the end of day 5, you'll have a list of all the
companies that make volume phase holographic gratings. Ideally they will
have found new companies, if not you've at least had a bunch of eyes
searching for the same thing.

They also have a spreadsheet that lists all of the diffraction gratings
from the company, along with costs and size and lpmm, etc.

This is the data on which you can build your knowledge. You're strategic
goals are to understand the direct competitors. What you will then be in
a unique position to do is look at the competitors and see where their
products compare directly in specification to ours.

That's the analysis you will do. The theory here is that because I will
outsource the collection, it will be faster than if I do it myself.

Then instead of a countless iteration of manually checking websites to
collate the data and fighting off fatigue, I'm meeting with people and
utilizing my unique strengths.

Then I either searched for Asia or the phillipines, and just paged through,
inviting as they looked promising.




Johna  responded with:
I hope you are doing well.

Thanks for your message. I certainly would be delighted to accept your job interview invite.

I can be reached on skype at johna.santiago.

I countered with:  Thanks for your response - how many hours do you estimate will be required? 


She responded with: 
Hi Nathan. This is only for campaign set up? No management and optimization required?

Is the campaign for Search only? Or Search and Display. Keyword and ad group theming might take time, I'm estimating 3-4 hours for keyword research and ad group theming. If you are thinking of doing Display campaign as well, targeting has to be planned. Also, i am not a graphic designer so I would need to ask for the banners from you.

In estimate, I think for search it would take me about 6-8 hours to set up. Thanks!

Finding talent on upwork: Non-hourly
Create the job as private, non-hourly.

Search for candidates:
Search for a keyword from the job description, such as "logo"
Set the filters to the following settings:
Hourly rate: $10 and below
Earned amount: 1K+
Freelancer type: Independent freelancer
Location: Asia
English Level: If this is required, use the tests, not the self-descriptions. 
The self-descriptions of native, fluent, etc. are not accurate.

Select the first 10 entries that you think will work, invite each to the job.
Review and accept their offers.


Finding talent on upwork: Hourly
Create the job as private, Hourly.
Hourly: Assumes you don't know how long the project will take.
Do same search for candidates as processed above.
For each positive response, ask for a time estimate.



For all postings, hourly and non-hourly:

As soon as the exact requirements have been met in the posting, be ready to pay.
If they meet the requirements and say "is that ok?", or "Do you have other changes?",
you can ask for more, but the idea
is to establish all positive relationships with them. Even if the work is bad, or just
a cut and paste job, give it 5 stars and all positives. That will pay dividends later
when other contractors view your job. 




There are literally thousands of people to search for that will meet your requirements.

If it's something specialized, make the job public. 
For example, the wake neighbors beautiful map task attracted Emil, who knows ArchiCAD, 
which led to options you had not envisioned for the task.

When reviewing responses, you're looking for a blend of cut and paste and actually
addressing the job description. When you ask for follow up communications, watch for red flags, 
like asking what the company name is, when it's clearly in the job posting. Be cautious,
as language barriers can make what appear to be inattention to detail explainable by
a poorly worded task.

On the other hand, when you find the talent, such as Johna - you gain instant, multiple
benefits from their clear communication and expertise.


After the jobs are over, record the results in this spreadsheet:

This is critically important as you want to measure their qualities, as well as your own.

Give them this task and choose the best:

Find the names and e-mails of the most succesful volunteer coordinators in the U.S.A.

An example of a such a person would be someone who has documented examples of creating or growing a team of volunteers for a charitable event. 

An example of such a person is Mary Ann Sibley.  Her linkedin profile is here:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/mary-ann-sibley-913b0b7a


On her linked in page, she lists:

Director, First Impressions - Core Services Hope Community Church February 2003 – October 2014 (11 years 9 months)
Created the First Impressions Ministry at Hope in 2005 with the vision to create a welcoming environment where people are served with intentional excellence and volunteers serve with joy and passion. This ministry grew from 40 volunteers to over 1, 000 volunteers as Hope's campus locations have grew to 3 locations.


Mary is a good example because she listed start and end times, growth numbers, and her responsibilities.

I already have Mary's information, and I need more like her.

Can you do this? If not, please advise. Please reply and confirm what you will plan to do to complete this task.
