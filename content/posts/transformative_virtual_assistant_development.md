Read this from top to bottom to find a path to success built on a pillar
of failure.

You are busy. You are valuable to the organization. There are things
that you are uniquely good at. This process will help you focus on those
things. Invest in freeing your time, and reap huge benefits as your
productivity increases through the systemization of your repetitive
tasks.

Goal: Create a transformative experience that increases your productivity 80%.

For any information related task, find a mechanism to discover
information workers, assign the work, and get 80% of the quality of
results in 20% of the time of doing each step manually yourself.

There are many resources espousing the benefits and mechanisms for
finding a virtual assistant. Some of the best:

[4HWW](https://tim.blog/2010/11/02/virtual-assistants/)

[Outsource Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245561)

This document is about the specific tactics used to find a virtual
assistant to help with biotechnology research related tasks. The main
assumption to be tested is that the search, identification and collation
of data can be outsourced. The first step is to identify a goal, and
then walk through each portion of the creation step manually. Then, once
the variation in research paths has been reduced to a known set of
states, (including an 'unknown' state), apply quantification metrics to
each end state.  Communicate the exact process to potential candidates,
and then evaluate their performance quantitatively.

Here's a quick example of what *not* to do:

Go into a local life sciences research library funded by the state's
biotech program. Ask for help finding market research reports on
diffraction gratings. Watch as they type in 'defraction grading' into a
life sciences database search tool and get zero results.

This is not their fault - this is your fault. This is an under
specification of search requirements, coupled with poor communication on
your part.

A better example is:
--------------------
<pre>
Search google for "diffraction grating" with quotes
Click the company page
Click products
Find any diffraction grating
    none available? -> Go to next google result
    At least one available?
        Create a new google doc for that company
        Append every diffraction grating specification of size, lpmm,
        center wavelength and cost on a new row in the google
        spreadsheet
        Add the company name to the main diffraction grating research
        document.
        Add a link to the company specific google doc to the main
        diffraction grating research document.
</pre>
Understand that this level of verbosity is not demeaning. This
specification of exact work products and steps to achieve them is
exactly what is required for effective collaboration. They have deep,
valuable skills in interpreting difficult to read web pages and
understanding where to find the information you are looking for.
Leverage their capabilities by first establishing a highly detailed set
of rules for building a shared language of activities.

The goal here is to eliminate the task as a variable. You're looking to
refine your candidates by spending approximately 500$ and 80 hours
collectively. What you're testing here is not your ability to write a
coherent task, but rather which candidates can communicate effectively
immediately.  Then you take it to phase two where you interview them in
person and share more of the strategic direction to see what level of
insight they can provide.

<pre>
Day 1: Post job, invite candidates
Day 2: Screen candidate responses
Day 3: Screen candidate responses, evaluate estimates
Day 4: Screen candidate responses, evaluate estimates
Day 5: Qualify results
</pre>

At the end of day 5, you'll have a list of all the companies that make
volume phase holographic gratings. Ideally they will have found new
companies, if not you've at least had a bunch of eyes searching for the
same thing.

They also have a spreadsheet that lists all of the diffraction gratings
from the company, along with costs and size and lpmm, etc.

This is the data on which you can build your knowledge. You're strategic
goals are to understand the direct competitors. What you will then be in
a unique position to do is look at the competitors and see where their
products compare directly in specification to ours.

That's the analysis you will do. The theory here is that because I will
outsource the collection, it will be faster than if I do it myself.

Then instead of a countless iteration of manually checking websites to
collate the data and fighting off fatigue, I'm meeting with people and
utilizing my unique strengths.

Title: Find the names and product listing of transmission diffraction grating companies.

Follow the steps below and stop after 3 hours and share your results.

Search google for "transmission diffraction grating" without the quotes

Ignore google scholar links.
Ignore google image links.
Ignore 'people also ask' links.

The Stop List, Found List, and gratings list is available on this google
doc: https://goo.gl/zhbi3v

1. Select the next link of the google results
2. Is link in 'Stop list'?
    Yes -> Go back to step 1.
    No -> go to step 3
3. Is link in the 'Found list'
    Yes -> Go to back to step 1
    No -> Go to step 4
4. Add the link to the Found List:
    Open the 'Found List' tab of the google sheet.
    Add the company name and the url
    Continue to step 5
5. Find a list of transmission gratings on the links' website. 

For each grating found, update the "Gratings List" tab of the
spreadsheet.

Equivalents for lpmm column include: lines/mm, l/mm, groove density.

Equivalents for diffraction efficiency column include: efficiency, absolute
efficiency.

If the links website is not a company (for example an education page
about gratings), add to the 'Stop List' and go back to step 1.

If the links website is a company, but does not have gratings for sale,
add to the 'Stop List' and go back to step 1.

If the links website is a company with gratings for sale but does not
have one of the fields of specification, fill in the value with NA.

7. If this is link 1-39 processed, go back to step 1. Otherwise, continue
to step 8.
8. If this is the 40th link processed, stop the entire process, share
results.

The first example of the results populated are shown in the google drive
document. Edmund optics is a good example because it lists the required
fields for each grating. These gratings are all transmission gratings,
not reflective gratings.

Only include transmission gratings in the document. Here are examples of
reflective gratings, do not include these or any like them:
https://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/gratings/reflective-ruled-diffraction-gratings/
https://www.newport.com/f/plane-holographic-reflection-gratings

Stop after 3 hours and share your results.

Thank you for your fastest reply.

</pre>

At first pass, this has produced about a 90% invite rate. Have invited
26 out of the first 30 entries.

This did not produce good results. This was a failure. The best results
you had was a cut and paste job from Susil 3 hours at 6$/hour that would
have taken you maybe 1 hour at most.

Well, maybe it wasn't a failure. It just feels like it's the wrong
person. That it's not an ultra-refined process so you need to spend alot
more, but you don't have a budget for alot more. Hmm.. If my time is
worth 50/hour, then every hour I save at 45/hour is still coming out
ahead.

Failure of upwork process due to lake of refinement
---------------------------------------------------

2017-12-26 13:15 I'm not clear enough about what is plain processing
according to rules, and what requires inuitive savvy that truly
represents your value.

Working backward - the face to face interaction with innovation
professionals, spectroscopists and potential customers is the place
where you can bring unique value. Everything else is a task that needs
to be automated to serve this purpose.

The following are the steps required to create these rules. This is
inspired primarily by: 
[Email system that saved my
life](http://hackthesystem.com/blog/the-email-management-system-that-saved-my-life/)
and the [partner video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QNnxkrJGW8&feature=youtu.be)


The goal here is to create a flow chart image for sharing. The time
should be spent on rules, not on moving the components around or manual
edge labelling. 

Use graphviz to create a directed graph that will catch every email. The
initial strategy is to setup a framework and have the discipline to
categorize all of the emails. Write down the exact decision making
process for each email. This is the core skill that will take time up
front, but will pay off very quickly for you, and whomever you outsource
your email to.

Start with this general framework.

    ::python
    /* Workflow for processing email.

    The goal here is a portable set of rules that anyone can be trained to
    follow.
    */
    digraph {
        bgcolor=black;
        node [color=green, fontcolor=green];
        edge [color=green, fontcolor=green];

        1.0 [shape=diamond; label="Inbox empty?"]

        2.0 [label="Update email processed worksheet, stop"]

        3.0 [label="Open oldest email in inbox"]

        4.0 [label="Label as Handle this Nathan"]

        99.0 [label="Archive"]

        rankdir=LR;
        rank=same {1.0, 2.0, 3.0 };

        1.0 -> 2.0 [label=yes]
        1.0 -> 3.0 [label=no]

        // Iterate here - always go from 3.0 to a new rule, and end up at
        // labelling as Handle this Nathan for new rule creation
        3.0 -> 4.0

        // Create rule always updates this flow chart
        4.0 -> 99.0

        99.0 -> 1.0 [color=red] // always go back to inbox

    }


Download the graphviz wrapper script from the
[BioWize](https://biowize.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/text-wrapping-with-dot-graphviz/)
blog entry:

    ::python
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
     
    my $usage = "setdotlabelwidth [char-width] < [dotfile]";
    my $width = shift() or die("Usage: $usage $!");
     
    while(<STDIN>)
    {
      if(m/label="(.*?)"/)
      {
        my $labeltext = (;
        my @words = split(/ /, $labeltext);
        my @newtext = ();
        my $newline = "";
        foreach my $word(@words)
        {
          if( length($newline) > 0 and
              length($newline) + length($word) > $width )
          {
            push(@newtext, $newline);
            $newline = "";
          }
          $newline .= " " if( length($newline) > 0 );
          $newline .= $word;
        }
        push(@newtext, $newline) if( length($newline) > 0 );
        my $newlabel = join("\\n", @newtext);
        s/label=".*?"/label="$newlabel"/;
      }
      print;
    }

On linux, run this shell script at every test iteration:

    ::python
    #!/usr/bin/bash
    #
    # render_show_flowchart.sh - push the provided dot language file through
    # the newline label insertion tool, then render and display in eye of
    # gnome full screen

    if [[ $# -ne 2 ]] ; then
        echo "You must specify a dot language filename, width"
        exit 0
    fi

    FILENAME=(
    LINEWIDTH=[

    OUTFILE="${FILENAME/.gv/newlines.gv}"
    OUTPNG="${FILENAME/.gv/.png}"

    cat ${FILENAME} | perl setdotlabelwidth.pl $LINEWIDTH > ${OUTFILE}
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]] ; then
        echo "Problem running line converter"
        exit 0
    fi

    cat ${OUTFILE} | dot -Tpng -o ${OUTPNG}
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]] ; then
        echo "Problem running png maker"
        exit 0
    fi


    eog -f $OUTPNG]) 


In practice it looks like:

<pre>
    (Make a change to the workflow graph)

    ./render_show_flowchart.sh email_workflow.gv 5

    (tweak, repeat)
</pre>

Implementation Narrative
------------------------

You're probably thinking - that's nice, but who wants that level of
process and abstraction impinging on my productivity? If you're a person
like me - hugely vulnerable to visual distractions, you desparately want
to live with the wrongness of the dot language edge routing. You
explicitly do not want to use ASCII art by hand, LibreOffice Draw, or
google sheets to position boxes. You want logical flow only in text mode
so you can rapidly iterate through the real value add: The exact
creation of a workflow to make email processing faster:

Step 1:
Follow the workflow document.

Step 2:
When an email arrives that does not meet any rules, iterate through the
creation of a rule at this position:
[![Iterate rules
here](/images/thumbnails/email_workflow_startup.jpg)](/images/email_workflow_startup.jpg)


Email Results
-------------

This search for a virtual assistant rapidly transitioned to refining
your own processes. The good news is email is now one-touch, one shot
response. Everything has a rule to follow and takes much less time to
process. By following the steps above, keeping that virtual assistant in
mind, a ultra-refined set of rules were processed to drastically reduce
email processing time.


Mid-2018 search for a virtual assistant
---------------------------------------

I want help setting appointments, scheduling follow ups, and doing other
customer discovery related tasks. The above approach went right to a
single product research tabulation task in detail.  This approach is
about selecting a virtual assistant first, then quantifying their
results, then selecting the best option.

I tried reaching out to a variety of virtual assistants on linkedin that
were local to Raleigh, NC. I tried connecting with a few offshore
organizations. The results were poor. Back to direct connections through
upwork.

This is based heavily on the strategies from [The Virtual
Hub](https://www.thevirtualhub.com/blog/hiring-a-virtual-assistant/)

Post the job first:

I wanted to continue this process with upwork.com.  I tried signing up

not a valid email. I communicated through cordince.com with their tech
support to resolve this. They disappeared.  On to other providers.


Hubstaff specific notes
---------------------
Rejection criteria:

Target 4$ an hour or less offshore
10$ or less on shore, with native english and perfect writing

Offshore:
2 punctuation or grammatical errors in first response
Pay rate 2x the target or more 

What is the cut off you need? For 8320 per year, you can have a full
time 4$ an hour phillipine assistant.

Or at 8$ an hour for 20 hours a week, 4 hours per weekday, which should
be plenty. Are you going cheap or not?

Phillipines definetly. Hubstaff talent definetly.

Do two experiments, one 4$ an hour 
one 8$ an hour 


2018-07-11 19:36 Set up 4 calls with Phillipines contractors only.
People who responded to the job posting and included examples of their
work or email contact directly. All of these are probably just cut and
pasters. Sent email requests for a phone conversation. 

First one was for Maributh at 19:30 - which she made it sound like she
was going to call me on phone number at 19:30 eastern on July 11th.
Double checked and it was clear. This is a good test - if they can't
figure that out then it's probably not worth pursuing. My guess is she's
still asleep because she sent the initial response at 9:00 am her time.
I triple checked, and it's easy to find out what time it is here. So
that first entry is a bust. No follow up emails from her, no contact
after she accepted the phone call request.

Also contacted three local, college educated US citizen virtual
assistants. All of whom have not responded days later.

Made another pass through the hubstaff interface and directly invited
others to the job. It's saturday in the philippines, waiting to hear
back on monday.

Well finally, got somebody on the phone. He wants western union. He
wants to send me a list of managers. That seems so shady. Like he's got
a list and wants to send it - 4$ an hour sounded great to him.

You said you would look into western union and send him some draft
proposals. If he will actually do the work then fine, otherwise this is
a giant frustration. In humility, you may not be understanding him
correctly. You are new to this and you may be just simply not
communicating effectively or mis-applying your cultural norms. The plan
is to let that relationship sit and see what others say below:


2018-07-17 13:58 Well the lack of communiation has been seriously
frustrating. This page says that is to be expected: [staff.com
VA](https://blog.staff.com/how-to-hire-a-virtual-assistant-from-the-philippines-for-2-50-to-5-50-per-hour/)

Now go through all the hubstaff entries of people who have applied and
people who you invited. Look for:

<pre>
The next step is to filter out the qualified applicants from those that
are unqualified.. In most cases, Rawson says, you can easily eliminate
about 70% of the applicants based on poor quality English, a weak
resume, or entry level experience. Once you have determined the most
qualified applicants, you provide each one with a test; each examination
depends on the tasks of the job. The test can range between 15 minutes
(unpaid) to as much as three hours (paid). At the end, you peruse the
test, evaluate them and you are left with just a few prospects.
</pre>

So go through each entry and read their response:
Do not filter out based on cost, only based on 
poor quality english
    (more than 2 grammatical or punctuation errors)

a weak resume
    no resume posted
    (no high school, no exact experience with technology mentioned)

or entry level experience.
    (not enough of the target experience)

That means connect with all the on-shore entries, all the offshore
entries that meet the criteria. This is worth it - if you can find a VA
even at 1/3 the cost if it's truly transformative then it's will pay for
itself quickly.

Specifically, click the first application.
If they fail the criteria above, click the 'thumbs down' button.

If they pass the criteria above, click the 'thumbs up' button, then

2018-07-21 12:30 Sent 4 Functional tests
Results:
Nobody uses RIA - everybody wanted paypal

Applicants
PP - did not respond immediately saying what he would do. Stopped at 2.5
hours according to his documentation

Actual document produced has 8 companies 29 people, some of which are
good, some have 'regional sales manager' and 'regional sales specialist'

That was 8$ USD per hour. Sent 16 dollars through paypal
The general feel from this doc is that formatting and making it look
pretty makes it easier to read and leaves a good impression.

TR - did not respond immediately saying what would be done. No
indicators of how much time was spent (but didn't ask for any)

Actual document produced has 19 companies, 41 people. Some of the
companies are resellers of xrays, some are not medical device companies
at all. To be fair that may be a specialized piece of knowledge to
differentiate between a company like orthotools which distributes
hundreds of medtech devices and looks like a medtech device company.

Sent an email in between to follow up about paypal that was not seen.

That was 25$ USD per hour for on shore.
The general feel from this doc was it was the bare minimum done in
anger.


KB - did respond immediately, kind of.

Actual document produced has about 50 companies, the first and last are
not even in the state, nor do they have a location in the state. Nor are
they even medical device companies. Not even close. Law firms in there
too. Shockingly bad results.

That was for 8$ USD per hour india.

Well that sucks.  3 total responses. Minimum cost is 8$ an hour, and is
of the quality I was expecting at 4$ an hour or less. If you remove the
paypal exercise in frustration it wasn't that bad.


2018-07-23 12:39 8/hr just feels too expensive. It's too much. That's
16k per year. 4$ hour seems more reasonable at 8k per year.

So the plan is to talk with PP just to finish the procedure. Ask him
these questions in the interview:



Then decide if you want to move forward with a few-week contract of a
group of tasks that you want to see done.  Now is not a good time for
you actually because you're feeling lazy. Because you're ready to just
pack it in and check out. Just like they will feel sometimes. Lead
yourself.

2018-08-03 15:51 None of those women of help references were successful
either.

Did get a very long delayed response by following the referall chain
from virtual assistants, ultimately went with that on-shore approach.
