What are your tactics used to achieve this?

Perform the research, incorporation, execution cycle for each stage.

```
Research:

    Stay focused on the strategies from the known effective materials.
    Read them backwards and forwards, and at different times of day. 
    
Incorporation:

    Part 1: 
        Write card stack for the subject.
        Memorize the cards precisely, with no higher order thinking.

    Part 2:
        Verify full, random order memorization.

    Part 3:
        Enter the mind gym. (See resources below)
        Visualize who you are becoming with the integration of these
            skills after the completion of part 4.
        Exit the mind gym.

    Part 4:
        Change the venue, and pick a random card.
        Perform self-talk with the contents of the card based on your
            current circumstances and goals.
        Repeat for all cards.
            
Execution:

    Use the tactics from the known effective materials.
    Perform the key activities for the current stage.
