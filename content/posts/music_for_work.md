    # on Fedora core 26
    # Download and install conda3

    pip install mps-youtube
    pip install youtube_dl

cancellation all the way. Play the music through this set. Turn on the
over ears, ensure the noise cancellation is on full, and put those on
over the in-ears. Play no sound through the over-ears, just use noise
cancellation.  It's 700$ on your head, and it's worth every penny.
