A method and system for automatically generating a notification of a
status of precipitation being received by a user-defined detection zone
within a geographic area. An image of the geographic area is received.
The image includes pixels associated with the detection zone. Each pixel
is associated with a sub-area of the detection zone. Characteristics
(e.g., colors) of the pixels are obtained. The characteristics indicate
intensities of precipitation being received by sub-areas of the
detection zone.
