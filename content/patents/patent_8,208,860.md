A transmitter transmits a signal to a receiver along a transmission
path. The respective positions of the transmitter and the receiver are
determined, and notice is received that a moving vehicle is proximate to
the transmission path. Responsive to such notice, the moving vehicle
position is determined, and such position is used with the transmitter
and receiver positions to determine whether the moving vehicle is
located between the transmitter and receiver positions. The calculated
time delay is then used to provide a corrective signal component, which
is employed to reduce degradation of the first component.
