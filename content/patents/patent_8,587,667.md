A system and method for implementing beyond field-of-view tracked object
positional indicators for television event directors and camera
operators. The present invention includes a camera having a
field-of-view. The camera tracks an off-screen object. A coordinate
manager blends an on-screen indication of distance that the object is
away from said field-of-view. The camera is positioned to avoid the
object in the field-of-view.
