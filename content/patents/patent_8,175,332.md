The visible sky is monitored by a set of cameras for contrails produced
by a high-altitude aircraft. In response to identifying a contrail, the
contrail is tracked across the field of view of the camera. Contrail
data generated when the contrail is identified and during the tracking
of the contrail is stored. The contrail data describes characteristics
of the contrail including the spread of the contrail and the movement of
the contrail across the field of view of the camera. Coordinates of the
high-altitude aircraft are determined and compared with the contrail
data to identify wind conditions.
