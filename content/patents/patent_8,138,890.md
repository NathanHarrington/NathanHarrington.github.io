A radio frequency identification system and method includes a tag reader
and radio frequency identification tag. The tag reader includes an
ultrasonic transducer capable of transmitting tones at selected
ultrasonic frequencies and a radio transmitter capable of transmitting
signals at selected radio frequencies. The tag reader includes a radio
receiver capable of receiving signals at selected radio frequencies. The
tag reader determines if a received radio frequency signal is modulated
at a selected ultrasonic frequency. The radio frequency identification
tag includes an array of combination resonator/reflectors. Each
combination resonator/reflector of the array includes an ultrasonic
resonator coupled to a radio reflector. Each resonator/reflector of the
array is tuned to a unique pair of selected ultrasonic frequencies and
selected radio frequencies.
