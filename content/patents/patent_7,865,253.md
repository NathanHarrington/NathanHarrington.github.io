A system and method detects low grade physical motions of an electronic
device, such as a laptop computer, and takes protective measures if the
physical motions match a pre-specified physical motion pattern. The
pre-specified physical motion pattern may have been selected as a
pattern which, if left alone, could cause cumulative damage to the
electronic device. Alternatively, the pre-specified motion pattern may
have been selected as a pattern which tended to indicate that more
aggressive and abrupt movements would be forthcoming. The system and
method further detects sustained motion (such as in a laptop bag) such
that the laptop may shut-off so that the laptop does not overheat or get
damaged.
