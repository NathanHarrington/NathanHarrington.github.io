The programming instructions are operable to create a voiceprint from
the current waveform if the current waveform is of a human voice.
Furthermore, the programming instructions are operable to determine one
of whether a match exists between the voiceprint and one library
waveform of one or more library waveforms, whether a correlation exists
between the voiceprint and a number of library waveforms of the one or
more library waveforms and whether the voiceprint is unique.
Additionally, the programming instructions are operable to transcribe
the current waveform into text and provide a match indication display
(MID) indicating an association between the current waveform and the one
or more library waveforms based on the determining.
