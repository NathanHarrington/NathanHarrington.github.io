A computer-implemented method, apparatus, and computer program product
for performing a search for data. In one embodiment, the process
    converts each character of the search query into a phonetic variant
    to form an inflected search query. The process then identifies a set
    of inflected data fields of a vector space library satisfying the
    inflected search query.
