patent_number: 7,949,900 

The Mission SoulPad may autonomously detect and configure components of
the information system (e.g., displays, sensors, emitters, transceivers)
to support the defined objectives of the Mission SoulPad. The Mission
SoulPad may also identify malfunctioning components of the information
system needing repair or replacement. Entire sensor and information
display suites may be transitioned simply by moving the Mission SoulPad
between available information systems. This ensures that mission
critical information is consistently available regardless of the type of
system the Mission SoulPad is connected to.
