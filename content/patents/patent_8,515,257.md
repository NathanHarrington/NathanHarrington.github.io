A sound processing circuit divides an audio input signal of a televised
sporting event into multiple audio segments. The audio input signal
includes crowd noise and announcer commentary. If an audio segment does
not exceed a pre-defined amplitude threshold, a voice removal utility
adds the audio segment to a recent crowd noise library and stores the
segment in an output buffer. If the amplitude of a segment exceeds the
threshold, the utility adds the segment to a recent announcer voice
library. The sound processing circuit generates an attenuated version of
the segment and blends the attenuated version with one or more mixed
segments from the recent crowd noise library. The voice removal utility
stores the attenuated and blended segment in the output buffer and
outputs one or more audio segments from the buffer in a chronological
order.
