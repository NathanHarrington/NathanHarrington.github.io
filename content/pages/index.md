Hi, my name is Nathan. I'm here to create, organize and give away
businesses. I have the privilege of searching for value
propositions at [Cordince](http://www.cordince.com).

Prior to this role, I focused my efforts on practicing software
engineering at IBM, various startups, and building spectroscopy
control systems. 


You can read much more in the [Blog](/category/articles.html), and find
my full contact information and resume on the [details](/pages/about.html)
