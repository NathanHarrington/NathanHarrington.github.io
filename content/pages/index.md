Hi, my name is Nathan. 

I have the privilege of searching for value
propositions at [Cordince](http://www.cordince.com),
where we build software systems for amplifying growth. Our focus is
software development in the tissue engineering space and machine
learning in the clinical laboratory.


Prior to this role, I focused my efforts on practicing software
engineering at IBM, various startups, and building spectroscopy
control systems. 


You can read much more in the [Blog](/category/articles.html), and find
my full contact information and resume on the [details](/pages/about.html)
page.
