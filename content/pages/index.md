Hi, my name is Nathan. I'm here to create, organize and give away
businesses. I have the privilege of searching for software value
propositions at [Wasatch Photonics](http://wasatchphotonics.com).

Prior to this role, I focused my efforts on practicing software
engineering at IBM, various startups, and for building spectroscopy
control systems. 

Here are some of my more most recent software projects:

* [LineGrab](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/LineGrab)
* [PySideApp](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/PySideApp)
* [CookBook](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/CookBook)




You can read much more in the [Blog](/category/articles.html), and find
my full contact information and resume on the [details](/pages/about.html)
page.
