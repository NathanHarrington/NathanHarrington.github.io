Title: Standing Invitation

One of the main motivations for me in running this site is to connect
with fellow (aspiring) entrepreneurs. **If you want to talk about
startups, I want to talk to you**. Just send me a message here:
harrington.nathan@gmail.com  I will reply to virtually anything you send
me.

If you happen to be in the Central North Carolina, USA area, I would
also love to meet up. Just send me an email. The first coffe (or Donut)
is on me!

I got the idea for this invitation from [Michael
Herrman](http://www.herrmann.io/standing-invitation.html). If you are
interested in running a (software) business online, I highly recommend
you check out his [website](http://www.herrmann.io/).
