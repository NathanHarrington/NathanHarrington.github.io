Use the open source
Sphinx-4 speech-recognition package to capture letters and numbers from
spoken conversations in near real time to create notes. Employ a custom
Sphinx-4 dictionary file to extract likely matches to spoken letters and
numbers. Process the text for higher order values such as phone numbers
and acronyms, and create a meeting annotator through search-engine
lookups and local databases.
