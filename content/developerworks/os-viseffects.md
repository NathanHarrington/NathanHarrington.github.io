Use EffecTV and Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) to create your own
real-time visual effects on live video. Learn how to integrate geometric
primitives, bitmap image loading, and simple motion tracking to create
your own games, leading-edge user interfaces, or immersive environments.
Explore the EffecTV and SDL architectures, and learn how to harness the
power of open source video processing on Linux.  Future versions to be
published here shortly include more advanced manipulations of the video
input to make interesting games.  version 0.1 is a simple "ball falling
down the screen game" where you have to jump around and duck and dodge.
versions 0.2 adds shrinking of your image on the video screen, and
occlusion of your head with funny images.
