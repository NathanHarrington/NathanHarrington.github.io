Use Linux or Microsoft Windows, the open source sndpeek program,and a
simple Perl script to read specific sequences of tonal events -
literally whistling, humming, or singing at your computer -- and run
commands based on those tones.  Give your computer a short low whistle
to check your e-mail or unlock your your screensaver with the opening
bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Whistle while you work for higher
efficiency.
