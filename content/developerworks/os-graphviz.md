Explore relationships among Web pages visually, The Graphviz program
from AT&T Research and others is a fantastic tool for automating the
visualization of complicated link sets. This article shows how to
combine the Graphviz tool set with Web-page thumbnail generators to
create new ways of visualizing any Web page's link structures. You can
use these techniques and descriptions to refine your display logic, and
create directed and undirected Graphviz charts to enhance your
understanding of organizational, software, and other complex linked data
sets.
