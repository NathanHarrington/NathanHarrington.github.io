Time-availability maps provide a listing of who is most likely to be
available for a certain hour in a certain location. Find out how to use
Google Earth and a log of your communications to map and identify the
time and place when availabilities match.  Featured in
an IBM developerWorks [podcast](/files/podcasts/feature-082608.mp3) with [Scott Laningham](http://scottlaningham.com).
