Recent pushes for "green" technology focus mostly on talk, with little
action for the typical home- or small-office environment. Many users
leave their systems online continuously through laziness or ignorance,
resulting in a significant source of power consumption, as well as an
additional vector for malware propagation. The tools and code presented
here allow you to find those inactive systems and securely start the
shutdown process. With a LinuxÂ® box monitoring your network connections
using Argus and some custom Perl code, any system that supports Perl can
be set to be remotely shut down when a centralized set of inactivity
rules are met.
