Unlike traditional single-screen setups, multi-screen display systems require
special consideration for user interfaces (UIs). This article presents
tools and code designed to address the acquisition and change of input
focus across multiple displays. By enhancing existing X Window System
focus information using Ghosd displays and the Synergy debug-level
output, multi-screen users can know precisely where their input focus is
even on displays 4200x3150 pixels and larger.
