For the first time, you can hit your computer and get a meaningful
response! Using Linux and the Hard Drive Active Protection System
(HDAPS) kernel drivers, you can access the embedded accelerometers on
IBM and Lenovo ThinkPads, then process the accelerometer data to read
specific sequences of "knocking" events -- literally rapping on the
laptop case with your knuckles - and run commands based on those knocks.
Give your computer a double tap to lock the screen, and knock in your
secret code to unlock. Tap the display lid once to move your mp3 player
to the next track -- the possibilities are endless.
