Measure the
total time of entry and verify the time between keystrokes to help
authenticate a user regardless of the data being entered. Require
nonprintable characters, such as backspace and break, in the password to
enable new levels of password obfuscation. Learn how to apply the open
source tools xev and Perl in keystroke dynamics to measure the
more-subtle characteristics of human-computer interaction.
