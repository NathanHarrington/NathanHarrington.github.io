 Most online mapping applications assume that the desired
view is always north at the top of the image. This article presents
tools and code that show how to replace the map image with an inverted
copy, where south is at the top. Using a Firefox extension and the
Imager Perl module, each tile that comprises the full image is
extracted, rotated, and placed back in the image at the appropriate
spot.
