Implement swipe and pinch gestures for Linux
applications by analyzing tools and code needed to add some of this new
gesture support on older Linux-enabled hardware. Building on the output
of the synclient program, the Perl code presented here allows you to
assign specific application functions to "Three-Finger Swipe," as well
as Open- and Close-Pinch gestures.  Demonstration
