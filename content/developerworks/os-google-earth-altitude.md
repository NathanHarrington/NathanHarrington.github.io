Recent applications have greatly increased the ease of development and
ubiquity of 2-D maps. Tools like MicrosoftÂ® Live Search Maps and Google
Maps offer a wealth of tools for enhancing these single-plane maps, but
often ignore altitude as the third dimension of information. This
article presents tools and code to allow you to extract height
information based on pixel colors, and apply that height information
across the mapping context. The end result is a third dimension of data,
showing more information in the same space and opening up new methods of
visualization for your map users.
