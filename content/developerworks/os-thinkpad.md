Use synthetic X Window System events and embedded accelerometers to
control applications by the movement of a laptop computer. Translate
gestures, such as shaking, into mode-switching commands with detection
algorithms to interact with applications in new ways. Develop tools to
help build the next generation of interfaces that use accelerometers,
such as applications for laptops and iPhones.
