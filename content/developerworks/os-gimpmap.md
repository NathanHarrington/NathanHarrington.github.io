Google and
MapQuest do a great job of creating maps of the outside world on the
fly. But what about our workspaces? This article shows how to define and
map places and people inside a building. Search, track, and plot
individual cubicles, rooms, employees, or assets. Graph the location of
individuals or groups of employees based on job function, or track
unused office space visually.
