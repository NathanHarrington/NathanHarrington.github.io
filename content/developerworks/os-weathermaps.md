Traditional
weather reports will give notice of vague forecasts and severe weather
alerts in your general area. The code and tools presented in this
article will allow you to create precise detection zones so you can
receive a page, SMS, or e-mail a few minutes before a precipitation
event is likely to occur at the monitored location. Use GD and Perl for
image processing of the NOAA WSR-88D radar data to create your own
precipitation alerts for precise areas. Choose your notification method
and let users know when the rain will begin and when it will clear.
