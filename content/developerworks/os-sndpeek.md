Identify speakers with sndpeek, Use sndpeek and custom algorithms to
match voices to a pre-recorded library. Create applications to let you
know who is speaking in teleconferences, podcasts, and live media
events. Build basic assistance programs to help the hearing-impaired
identify speakers in a bandwidth-limited context.  Demonstration video at [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRtBKmNUjug).com
