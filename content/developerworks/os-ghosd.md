Let system events kick off on-screen alerts displaying text and images,
Use Perl, Ghosd, and some network programming to display on-screen
overlays of text and graphics based on messages from your local system
and remote computers. Define custom images, font sizes, and colors to
convey information integrated with your desktop.
