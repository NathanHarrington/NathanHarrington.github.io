Create your own 404 error-message handler to provide useful links and
redirects for the contents of your site. Use metaphone matching and a
simple weighted score file to make typographical, spelling, and bad-link
redirect suggestions. Customize the suggestions based solely on your Web
site's content and preferred redirection locations. Catch multiple
errors in incoming URL requests and process them for corrections in
directory, script, and HTML page names.
