Modify the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) to support user verification through
keystroke-dynamics processing. Create and store a one-way encrypted hash
of your keystroke patterns when entering your user name. Add code to GDM
to read current keystroke patterns and permit a user to log in when the
characteristics are a match.  [Slashdot
