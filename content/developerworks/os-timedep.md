Create an
SDL-enabled application that allows you to create distortion portals in
sequential image frames to explore the relationship of data sets through
time. This article demonstrates code and techniques to create "animated
distortion portals" in the data to provide time-dependent visualizations
of various parts of the image. Additionally, certain aspects of the code
are presented that allow for effective visualization on slower-computing
platforms without sacrificing usefulness.  Demonstration [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot60Us-9jfY) at youtube.com
