Use SoX, and a Perl script to do simple keyword matching and create
sound files played back upon receipt of e-mail. No more simple ding to
indicate the arrival of an e-mail regardless of recipient, sender, or
subject. You can now hear a ding-bang-whoosh signifying an e-mail from
your manager, or a bell-squawk-chirp to let you know your bank statement
is available. Local cached text. Audio example with glasses, sparcle,
space2.Another example with glasses, laser, space3.
