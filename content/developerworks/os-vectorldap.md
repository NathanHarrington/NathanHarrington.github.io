Use Perl and a
vector-space search engine to search and display records from your
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) database. Use inflected
letters and numbers to create a useful vector space from structured LDAP
data. Compensate for typographical and spelling errors automatically
while showing the most appropriate match for any query entered.
